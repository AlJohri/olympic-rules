Synchronized swimming 101: Olympic history
==========================================

Learn the history of the Olympic sport of synchronized swimming at the 2016 Rio Games.

**London, 2012**
Russia pulled off a double victory, winning the duet competition as well as the team event. A new Russian duo of Natalia Ishchenko and Svetlana Romashina captured the duet gold. Spain's Ona Carbonell and Andrea Fuentes captured silver; the silver was Fuentes' second consecutive silver, though this time, with a different partner. China's Xuechen Huang and Ou Liu took home the bronze. U.S. athletes Mariya Koroleva and Mary Killman finished 11th.

Ishchenko and Romashina were part of the Russian squad which won its fourth consecutive gold in the team event in a final score of 98.930. China followed with 97.010 for silver with Spain earning bronze with a score of 96.920. Both Spain's and China's duet team members competed in their respective team event, as well.

**Beijing, 2008**
Russia continued its dominance in the synchronized swimming competition. The tandem of Anastasia Davydova and Anatasia Ermakova defended their duet gold medal in Beijing with a near flawless free routine. The Russian synchronized swimmers, who not only shared the same first name but also age, height, weight, and hometown, received all perfect 10s for technical merit in their final free routine and won with a combined 99.251 points. Gemma Mengual and Andrea Fuentes of Spain captured the silver medal with 98.334 points and Japan's Saho Harada and Emiko Suzuki took the bronze with 97.167 points.

Davydova and Ermakova would return to the medal stand days later as part of the Russian squad that captured gold in the team competition. With a combined point total of 99.500, Russia won its third consecutive synchronized swimming team title. Spain followed its silver medal performance in the duet competition with the same medal in the team event. China, with a combined 97.334 points, won the bronze.

**Athens, 2004**
The 18 months leading up to the Games were a tragic roller-coaster for the U.S.' Tammy Crow. In February 2003, she slid off a snow-covered road and into a pair of pine trees, killing Crow's 26-year-old boyfriend Cody Tatro, and 12-year-old Brett Slinger, one of Tatro's students. Crow, who underwent four and a half hours of surgery in which 11 screws and a plate were inserted into her right humerus to stabilize it, recovered from the accident and helped the U.S. to a bronze medal in the team competition. Russia won its second straight gold and Japan took silver. Following the Games, Crow, who pleaded no contest to vehicular manslaughter charges stemming from the accident, served a three-month jail sentence.

**Sydney, 2000**
Following the success of synchronized swimming in Atlanta, Olympic organizers revived the duet event for the 2000 Games. Russia - following fourth-place finishes in the solo event and duet in 1992 (by Unified Team athletes) and an identical placing in the 1996 team competition - captured its first medal in the sport as Olga Broushnikina and Maria Kisseleva won gold. With Japan second and France third, this marked the first time neither the Canadian nor American flag was raised at a synchro medal ceremony.

After taking gold in the duet, the Russian women delivered a nearly faultless routine, got four perfect 10s, and won the team title. Using a witch-themed routine, which had been kept a secret prior to the Olympics, Russia scored 99.146.

A perennial bronze medalist in synchronized swimming since the sport's Olympic introduction in 1984, Japan took a step up on the podium in 2000, and one toward becoming a force in the sport. After Miya Tachibana and Miho Takeda claimed silver in the duet event, Japan went back for seconds, out-performing the U.S. and Canada to finish runner-up in the team competition.

**Atlanta, 1996**
For the 1996 Atlanta Games, the solo and duet events were eliminated from the synchronized swimming program. In their place was added a team competition, in which the final standings were identical to the 1994 World Championships. The United States, buoyed by a perfect score in its free routine, took gold, ahead of rival Canada.

**Barcelona, 1992**
Team USA's identical twins Sarah and Karen Josephson won the duet competition. Finishing second was another pair of identical twins, Canada's Penny and Vicky Vilagos. Amazingly, this wasn't the first such development in Olympic history. In the 1980 Olympic rowing competition, two sets of twins went gold-silver in the men's pair event: East Germans Joerg and Bernd Landvoigt (gold) and Soviets Yuri and Nikolai Pimenov.

Synchronized swimming's solo event title went to Californian Kristen Babb-Sprague. The runner-up was long-time rival Sylive Frechette of Canada, who competed despite the death of her fiance shortly before the Games. But the 1-2 finish didn't stand - more than a year later, a scoring controversy was resolved, and Frechette was upgraded to co-gold medalists.

**Seoul, 1988**
In a reversal of the 1-2 event solo finish from 1984, Canada's Carolyn Waldo took gold ahead of American Tracie Ruiz-Conforto at the Seoul Games. Two days later, Waldo teamed with Michelle Cameron to win the duet title, edging U.S. twins Sarah and Karen Josephson. Synchronized swimming provided Canada with two of its three gold medals in Seoul (boxer Lennox Lewis won the other).

**Los Angeles, 1984**
Synchronized swimming made its Olympic debut in the 1984 Los Angeles Games. The U.S.' Candy Costie and Tracie Ruiz became the first Olympic champions in synchronized swimming when they won the duet. The 21-year-old Ruiz also prevailed in the solo competition, which was added only two and a half months before the Games began. The International Swimming Hall of Fame named Ruiz, a Seattle native, "Synchronized Swimmer of the Century."

**Early history**
Esther Williams qualified for the U.S. Olympic Team as a swimmer in 1940, but missed out on those Games because they were cancelled due to World War II. Williams went on to star in aqua musicals, featuring choreographed swimming and underwater ballet routines, such as "Bathing Beauty" (1944) and "Neptune's Daughter" (1949), which contributed greatly to the early evolution and popularity of synchronized swimming. Synchronized swimming is one of only two Olympic disciplines that are female-only; however, at the most recent world championships in 2015, a mixed duet event was included in the program for male/ female pairs.
