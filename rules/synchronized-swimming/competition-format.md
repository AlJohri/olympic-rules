Synchronized swimming 101: Competition format
=============================================

Learn the competition format for the Olympic sport of synchronized swimming at the 2016 Rio Games.

In both the team and duet events, nations perform their routines one after the other in front of three panels of five judges each. Each panel judges one aspect of the routine – during the technical routine, the panels judge execution, impression, and elements;  during the free routine, the panels judge execution, artistic impression, and difficulty. The order in which nations compete is determined by a draw. Routines must be executed within a certain time limit, depending on the event and whether it is a technical or free routine. Judges announce their scores at the end of each routine.

Team events take two days, the first spent on the technical routine and the second on the free routine. Duet events take three days. The second day is reserved for free routines, after which the competition is narrowed down from 24 duets to 12.

The last day of competition is the final, during which the duets perform their free routines again. The final 12 are broken up into two groups to determine the starting order, again by a draw. Those duets that placed 1 through 6 in preliminaries will draw for start numbers 7 through 12, and those who placed 7 through 12 in preliminaries will draw for start numbers 1 through 6.
