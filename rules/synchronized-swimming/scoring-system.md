Synchronized swimming 101: Scoring system
=========================================

Learn how the Olympic sport of synchronized swimming is scored at the 2016 Rio Games.

**Jury**
The judging for synchronized swimming is similar to the judging for gymnastics or figure skating. In both the duet and team events, two panels of five judges each score both routines (technical and free). One panel rates technical merit, the other focuses on artistic impression.

**Technical merit scoring breakdown**

-   Execution of strokes, figures and parts thereof, propulsion techniques and precision of patterns accounts for 40 percent.
-   Synchronization of one with the other(s) and the music accounts 30 percent for team, 20 percent for duet.
-   Difficulty of strokes, figures and parts thereof, patterns and synchronization accounts 30 percent for team, 40 percent for duet.

**Artistic Impression scoring breakdown**

-   Choreography variety, creativity, pool coverage, patterns and transitions are considered and accounts 60 percent.
-   Music interpretation accounts 20 percent.
-   Manner of presentation, overall command of the routine accounts for 20 percent.

**Points**

To score a routine, each of the 10 judges uses a scale of 0.00 to 10.00 (0 being a fail, 10 being a perfect score).

**Penalties**
In either the technical or free routine, a one-point penalty will be deducted for the following:

-   The time limit of 10 seconds for deck movements is exceeded
-   There is a deviation from the specified routine time allowance

A two-point penalty will be deducted for the following:

-   A competitor makes deliberate use of the bottom of the pool during the routine.
-   A routine is interrupted by a competitor during deck movements and a new start is allowed.
-   A swimmer holds on to the side of the pool.

A half point penalty may be deducted in the technical routine only for each part of a required element omitted from the routine. A two point penalty will be deducted for each required element omitted or for performing technical elements in the wrong order.

**Routine score**
To achieve a score for a technical or free routine, the highest and lowest scores awarded for technical merit and for artistic impression are dropped; the remaining three scores in each category are averaged. The technical merit score is then multiplied by five, as is the artistic impression score. Those numbers are added together to derive the total score for that particular routine with a maximum total of 100 points.

**Team final**
For the team competition, to arrive at the final score, the technical routine score (minus penalties) is multiplied by 0.5 and the free routine score (minus penalties) is multiplied by 0.5. Those totals are added together for the final score. This score, which accounts for 50 percent of the final score with the free routine as the remaining 50 percent, determines where a team ranks in the final standings.

**Duet preliminary score**
In the duet competition, to arrive at the preliminary score, the technical routine score (minus penalties) is multiplied by 0.5 and the free preliminary routine score (minus penalties) is multiplied by 0.5. Those totals are added together for the total preliminary score. The top 12 duets based on the total preliminary score will perform in the free routine final.

**Duet final score**
To arrive at the final duet score, the technical routine score from the preliminary round is multiplied by 0.5 and the free routine score from the final (the only routine performed in the final) is multiplied by 0.5. Those totals are added together to achieve a final score that determines final rankings.
