Weightlifting 101: Competition format
=====================================

Learn the competition format for weightlifting at Rio 2016.

**Weigh-in**
On the day a weightlifter is to compete, he or she will participate in a weigh-in beginning two hours before the start of competition. Athletes are weighed naked or in underwear. During the weigh-in, a coach writes on the competitor's card what his or her initial attempt will be for each weightlifting discipline (the snatch and the clean and jerk).

**Format**
In men's Olympic weightlifting, athletes in the same bodyweight category are split into groups of 8 to 12 lifters, with the better lifters in Group A, the others in Group B. The groups compete in reverse order (B then A). Medalists are usually decided from the A group. For women, there is only one group. The order of lifts is snatch, then clean and jerk. The order of competitors is determined by random draw, and remains the same throughout the competition. The order could be an important factor -- if two athletes have lifted the same total weight and have the same body weight, the winner is the one who first achieved the total. At the Olympics, medals are awarded to the top three competitors in each weight class based on the highest combined totals from both lifts -- the snatch and the clean and jerk.

**Referees**
In Olympic weightlifting, three referees evaluate each lift. Once a referee makes a decision, he or she presses a white (good lift) or red (no lift) button on the scoring device. When a button is pressed, a light appears, corresponding to the color of the button. As soon as two of the three referees have made the same decision (white or red), a visible and an audible signal is given to the lifter, indicating he or she can lower the barbell.

**Jury**
During the Olympic weightlifting competition, a five-member jury monitors the referees to ensure that the rules are correctly adhered to. The jury may reverse a referee's decision only if the following occurs:

1.  The jury unanimously agrees that there has been a rule breach.
2.  The jury unanimously agrees to reverse the decision.

If the jury is not unanimous on both accounts, then the referee's decision stands.
