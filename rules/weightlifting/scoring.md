Weightlifting 101: Scoring
==========================

Learn how weightlifting is scored at Rio 2016.

A weightlifter's score is tabulated by adding up his or her biggest lift in each of the two disciplines: snatch and clean & jerk.

A lifter may finish in a position other than first in either of the disciplines and come away as the overall champion. Â Very often, the overall winner has the best lift in at least one of the disciplines.

In the event of a two-way tie for first, the lifter with the lower body weight at the pre-competition weigh-in is declared the winner.
