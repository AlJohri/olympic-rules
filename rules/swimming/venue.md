Swimming 101: Venue
===================

Learn where the Olympic sport of swimming will take place at the 2016 Rio Games.

Rio de Janeiro's swimming events will be contested in the Olympic Aquatics Center in the Barra Olympic Park. The temporary facility will include seating for about 15,000 spectators. The pool is 3 meters in depth.

The venue will additionally host the water polo finals and Paralympic swimming events. It contains two Olympic-sized swimming pools: one for competition and another for warm up.

Rio de Janeiro is already home to two aquatics centers, the Maria Lenk and Julio Delamare facilities, which are capable of hosting international and national events. The Olympic Aquatics Center is designed as a temporary facility as that was the most cost effective option. There was talk of a plan to leave the facility as an Olympic Training Center, but that was disregarded.

The exterior of the building is decorated with 66 panels in a reproduction of celebrated Brazilian artist Adriana Varej?o's " *Celacanto Provoca Maremoto* *."*

Fort Copacabana, in the Copacabana complex of the Rio Games, will host the open water swimming event on Aug. 15 and 16.
