Swimming 101: Rules
===================

Learn the rules of the Olympic sport of swimming at the 2016 Rio Games.

**Starts**
For freestyle, breaststroke, butterfly and IM events, swimmers begin by diving into the water from a starting platform. On the referee's whistle, each swimmer steps onto the platform; on the starter's command, "take your mark," each swimmer assumes a starting position. When all swimmers are stationary, the starter activates an electronic tone to start the race. In swimming, there are no "false start" warnings. Any swimmer who starts before the starting signal has been given is automatically disqualified. If the starting signal sounds before the disqualification is declared, the race continues and the swimmer(s) will be disqualified when the race is over. Once in the water, a swimmer's head must break the surface within the first 15 meters; this rule also applies after turns.

For backstroke events, as well as the start of the medley relays, swimmers start on the FINA-approved "backstroke ledge." At 80cm long but only 2cm wide, the ledge is designed to keep swimmers from slipping on starts and provide more consistency, as does the "fin" on the typical starting block. It can be adjusted in 2cm increments from water level to up to 4 inches above or below the water's surface. The ledge was introduced in 2014 and makes its Olympic debut at the Rio Games. Swimmers still have the option not to use the "fin" if they choose to start using the touchpad, as has been standard in the past. On the referee's first whistle, swimmers enter the water; on the referee's second whistle, swimmers assume a starting position. The starter then says, "take your mark," and when all swimmers are stationary, the starting signal is activated.

**Turns**
Quick turns are essential to a good race (with the exemption of the 50m freestyle, which is only one length of the pool). In all events, swimmers must touch the wall, but in freestyle and backstroke, swimmers may somersault as they reach the wall, touching it only with their feet. In the other two competitive strokes - butterfly and breaststroke - swimmers must touch the wall with both hands simultaneously before executing the turn. Swimmers must come up and make a stroke within the first 15m of the wall after making a turn.

**Strategy**
There are some major differences between how swimmers approach the different races on the Olympic program. The sprint races (50m and 100m) are all-out scrambles from start to finish (sometimes referred to as the "splash and dash"). The slightest mistake can cost a swimmer a fraction of a second, and thus the race. The 200m events require swimmers to have a sense of pace as well as the ability to swim a controlled sprint. This distance is considered by many to be the most difficult to master. The distance events - the 400m, 800m (women only) and 1500m (men only) freestyles - require swimmers to constantly be aware of their position in a race and to closely monitor the fatigue of their muscles. Swimming the first portion of the race too fast can sap a swimmer's strength and cause a poor finish; swimming the first portion too slowly can create a deficit impossible to make up. Swimmers may elect to swim the race evenly (holding the same pace throughout the race) or they may "negative split" the race, covering the second half faster than the first half. In the late 1970s and early '80s, "negative splitting" was considered the best way to win distance races. World records have been set using "even pace" tactics as well.

*Swimming strokes*

**Freestyle**
By definition, a freestyle swimmer can use any stroke. But the fastest is the "Australian crawl" (also known as the "front crawl"), which is characterized by an alternating overhand motion of the arms and a flutter or scissor kick. The arm movement has three distinct segments: pull, push and recovery. A two-beat-per stroke kick is used in distance races; a faster, six-beat kick is used in sprint events and in the final stretch of distance races. Breathing patterns vary depending on the distance of an event and a competitor's preferred style; in the 50m freestyle, for example, some competitors don't breathe at any point in the race.

Freestyle has been swum at every modern Olympics. Today, distances contested are 50m, 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m (women only), 1500m (men only) and 10k open water. There also are two freestyle relay races: 4x100m and 4x200m.

During the 10k competition, each athlete must wear a wristband known as a transponder, which is linked to the timing and results system. Athletes can be disqualified for pacing, slip-streaming, walking or jumping, or finishing without their transponder. The athletes are also identified by temporary tattoos or markers on their upper arms, shoulder blades and wrists.

**Backstroke**
The backstroke is an alternating motion of the arms - much like the freestyle in reverse - with a flutter kick. Backstroke swimmers must stay on their backs, except during the turns (swimmers can "roll" their bodies up to, but not including, 90 degrees from horizontal).

A backstroke swimmer's head must break the surface within 15m of the start of the race.

The backstroke was first contested at the 1900 Paris Games; Olympic distances are 100m and 200m.

**Breaststroke**
The slowest of the four Olympic strokes, the breaststroke is highly technical and therefore difficult to master. The arms must move in the same horizontal plane simultaneously; the hands propel forward from the breast (on, under or over the water) and are brought back on or under the water surface but not beyond the hip line, except during the first stroke after the start and turns; the elbows remain underwater except on the stroke before turns or the final touch; the kick is a simultaneous thrust of the legs called a "frog" or breaststroke kick. No flutter or dolphin kicking is allowed, except for one dolphin kick per pullout; a pullout is done at the start and after each turn.

Except for after the start and turns, some part of the swimmer's head must come above water during each cycle of a stroke and kick. Touching the wall at turns or the finish must be done with both hands simultaneously.

The breaststroke, which first appeared at the Olympics in 1908, is contested over distances of 100m and 200m.

**Butterfly**
The most powerful and physically demanding stroke, the butterfly involves simultaneous overhead stroking of the arms combined with a dolphin kick. The dolphin kick features both legs moving up and down together. No flutter kicking is allowed.

A butterfly swimmer must touch the wall with both hands simultaneously before turning and his or her head must surface within 15m of the start and after turns.

Butterfly initially developed from breaststroke, when swimmers would recover their arms above the water. Butterfly became an independent stroke and made its Olympic debut at the 1956 Melbourne Games. The stroke is contested over distances of 100m and 200m.
