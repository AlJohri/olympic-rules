Swimming 101: Qualifying
========================

Learn how swimmers qualified for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.

FINA, the world governing body for swimming, sets time standards that athletes must meet in order to qualify for the Olympics. Countries are allowed a maximum of two swimmers in each individual event and one team in each relay event. A country may only send two swimmers if those swimmers both qualify under the "A" time standard set by FINA. If a country does not have a swimmer(s) who qualifies for an event under FINA's "A" time, it may still send a swimmer to the Olympics if it has a competitor who meets FINA's "B" standard for an event. In this case, one and only one competitor from a country can contest the particular event. In all cases, a country's National Olympic Committee holds the authority on choosing which competitors who qualify under the time standards will compete in the Games. No nation may enter more than 26 men and 26 women in the swimming competition.

*10k open-water qualifying* (men and women)
There are 24 qualification places available for both men and women in the marathon swim, plus one additional place for the host country, Brazil. No country is allowed to enter more than two athletes. The 24 spots are awarded to:

-   Top 10 finishers from the 2015 FINA World Championships held July 24 through Aug. 9 in Kazan, Russia.
-   Top nine finishers from the FINA Olympic Marathon Swim Qualifier race, held June 11-12 in Setubal, Portugal. 2016 marks the second consecutive time the qualifier has been held in Setubal.
-   One swimmer from each of the five FINA continents - Africas, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania.
-   One swimmer from host nation Brazil, if not already qualified directly. The unused host country spot will be reallocated to the next best ranked athlete of the same gender from the Qualifier event that is not yet qualified.

Federations without qualified swimmers may enter one man and one woman (regardless of time standards) in one competition each of their choice, if the individual(s) participated in the prior world championships. According to FINA rules, FINA will determine whether to allow the swimmer(s) to compete at the Olympics, "based on their performance."
