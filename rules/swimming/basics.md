Swimming 101: Basics
====================

Learn the basics of the Olympic sport of swimming at the 2016 Rio Games.

The 2012 Olympic swimming program comprises 32 pool events contested in a span of eight consecutive days, as well as the 10k open water event. A total of 96 swimming medals will be up for grabs at the 2016 Rio Games, plus an additional three medals each for the men's and women's open water 10k events. With noted exceptions, the following strokes and distances are contested by both men and women:

**Freestyle**
50m (one length of the pool)
100m (two lengths)
200m (four lengths)
400m (eight lengths)
800m (16 lengths; women only)
1500m (30 lengths; men only)
10k (open water swim)

**Backstroke**
100m (two lengths)
200m (four lengths)

**Breaststroke**
100m (two lengths)
200m (four lengths)

**Butterfly**
100m (two lengths)
200m (four lengths)

**Individual medley**
200m (four lengths)
400m (eight lengths)

**Relays**
4x100m freestyle (each swimmer swims two lengths)
4x200m freestyle (each swimmer swims four lengths)
4x100m medley relay (each swimmer swims a different stroke two lengths; the order is backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, freestyle)

**The IM**
The individual medley, commonly referred to as the "IM," features all four competitive strokes. In the IM, a swimmer begins with the butterfly, changes to the backstroke after a quarter of the race, swims the breaststroke for another quarter and finishes with the freestyle.

**The freestyle relay**
In the freestyle relays, four swimmers from the same country each swim a quarter of the total distance. No individual may swim more than one leg of the relay. An individual world record in the 100m freestyle or 200m freestyle can be set in a relay race, but only by an athlete swimming the first leg. A relay start is considerably faster because swimmers can leave the blocks up to .03 of a second before the previous swimmer touches the wall. A relay start is generally considered to make for a split time about .6 faster than a "flat" start. Leaving the blocks .04 seconds before the swimmer touches the wall results in an automatic disqualification. Sensors on the starting blocks can measure the time between one swimmer touching the wall and the next swimmer leaving the blocks. Swimmers who compete in the preliminary are eligible for a medal if the team from their country earns one in the finals. Often, different swimmers compete in the relay prelim than in the final.

**The medley relay**
In the medley relay, all four strokes are swum by four different swimmers, all from the same country. Each athlete swims 100m. No athlete may swim more than one leg of the relay. The stroke order is backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, freestyle. It is possible to set a world record in the 100m backstroke (the first leg) in this race. As in the freestyle relay, swimmers who compete in the preliminary are eligible for a medal if the team from their country earns one in the finals. Sometimes, different swimmers compete in the relay prelim than in the final.
