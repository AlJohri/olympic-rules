Gymnastics 101: Qualification
=============================

Learn how each athlete earned their spot at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

There will be a total of 98 male and 98 female gymnasts at the 2016 Rio Olympics, with no more than ten athletes (five men and five women) per country. All male gymnasts must turn 18 by Dec. 31, 2016 and all female gymnasts must turn 16 by Dec. 31, 2016.

The first qualifying event for the Rio Olympics was the 2015 World Championships in Glasgow, Scotland. The countries that were ranked 1st to 8th in the team final earned team quota places of five athletes. The second qualifying event was the Rio Test Event held in Rio, Brazil in April. The top four teams at the Rio Test Event also earned team quota places.

Individual athletes also won quota places through either winning individual apparatus medals at the 2015 Worlds or placing high enough in the all-around at the Rio Test Event. The teams that fell short of qualifying full five-person berths at the Test Event did earn one individual berth, which they can allocate to the athlete of their choice.

Finally, the International Gymnastics Federation granted Olympic berths to select athletes to ensure that minimal continental representation (at least two quota places for Africa, America, Asia and Europe and one quota place for Oceania) is achieved and the Olympic Tripartite Commission named one male and one female athlete from a country that has had eight or fewer Olympic athletes at the previous two Games.
