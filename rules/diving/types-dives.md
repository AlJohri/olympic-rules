Diving 101: Types of dives
==========================

Learn which types of dives are featured at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

**Categories**

Forward: With body facing forward and dive made forward.

Backward: Back to the water and rotating away from the board.

Reverse: Diver facing forward and rotating back toward the board.

Inward: Back to the water and rotating forward toward the board.

Twisting: Any dive with a twist is included in this group, whether forward, backward, reverse or inward.

Armstand (platform only): The diver begins the dive from a motionless handstand on the edge of the platform while upside-down.

**Positions**

Straight: Body remains straight.

Pike: Body bent at the waist, with legs straight.

Tuck: Body bent at the knees and hips, with knees held together and drawn to the chest, heels close to the buttocks.

Free: A combination of straight, pike or tuck, used only in twisting dives.

**Building a dive**

The two primary elements that go into constructing a dive are categories and positions. There are five categories of dives, each labeled by the type of flight. Each group of dives must begin with one component of the flight group - forward, backward, reverse, inward, twisting and armstand (platform only) - to be the starting point of the dive. Divers then utilize different positions within the dive - straight, pike, tuck and free - in order to complete different dives.

**Dive numbers**

It is through these categories and positions that dives, and dive numbers are created. When divers submit their list of dives for a round of competition, they identify each dive by number. Traditionally, a dive has three or four numbers, followed by a letter (i.e. 305B or 5132D). Numbers correspond to the categories or positions in a dive.

**Three-digit dives**

First number: The first number of every three-digit dive corresponds to a category:

1: a forward dive.
2: a back dive.
3: a reverse dive.
4: an inward dive.
5: a twisting dive (only four-digit dives begin with a "5").
6: a dive begun in an armstand position.

Second number: The second number of every three-digit dive specifies the initial position of flight. This number is almost always zero (unspecified position) and occasionally 1 (for a dive begun in a straight position).
Third number: The third number of a three-digit dive signifies the number of half-somersaults that will be performed.

The letter: After the three digits of the dive number, a letter is added to signify the dive position:

A: straight position
B: pike position
C: tuck position
D: free position

Example: A 301B would be reverse dive, with a half somersault in the pike position. A 107B is a forward dive, with 3 1/2 somersaults in the pike position.

**Four-digit dives**

Some dives necessitate four numbers. Dives that begin with "5" mean twisting dives, and follow with the takeoff position (i.e. "2" for back), the number of half-somersaults, the number of half twists, and finally the letter denoting position.

Example: A 5237D is a back dive with 1 1/2 somersaults, 3 1/2 twists, free position dive.

Dives that begin with "6" are armstand dives. They can include three or four numbers before the letter. If a dive begins with "6," the first digit signifies an armstand dive, the second digit signifies forward (1) or backward takeoff (2), the third digit denotes the number of half-somersaults executed, the fourth number (if necessary) denotes the number of half-twists, and the letter signifies the position.

Example: A 612B is a dive executed from the armstand position, forward off the board with one full somersault in the pike position.
