**Individual event format**

In women's 3m springboard and 10m platform competitions, divers execute five dives from the different groups (forward, backward, reverse, inward, and twisting; plus armstand in platform only) without a limit on degree of difficulty.

In men's springboard and platform, divers execute six dives from different groups, with one from each of the five groups plus an additional dive from any group, without a limit on degree of difficulty.

Preliminary round: The order of the dives is selected by the diver. The top 18 divers from the preliminary round advance to the semifinal. If there's a tie for 18th, all tied divers advance.

Semifinal: The divers' scores do not carry over from the preliminaries into the semifinal. Again, the divers select their order of dives. The 12 divers with the highest score from the semifinal round advance to the final; in the event of a tie for 12th, the tied divers all advance.

Final: The divers scores do not carry over from the semifinal into the final. In the final round, divers are placed in reverse order of their standings following the semifinal round. The diver with the highest score from the final is the winner.

**Synchronized event format**

There is only one phase to the synchronized diving competition. The women perform five dives from at least four groups, with at least one dive forward facing that is not in a standing position on the springboard. The men perform six dives from at least four groups, with at least one dive forward facing that is not in a standing position on the springboard. Within the six rounds, a group cannot be used more than twice. None of the same dives may be repeated.

**Other rules**

Each competitor must deliver to the diving secretary - no less than 24 hours before the date of the competition - four copies of a complete program of the dives he or she will perform. The dives must be executed in the order as listed.
