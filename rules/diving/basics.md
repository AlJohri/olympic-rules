==================

Learn the basics of the sport of diving at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

There are eight diving events in the Olympics.
Four are individual:

-   Men's and women's 3m springboard
-   Men's and women's 10m platform

The other four are team events that debuted at the 2000 Sydney Games:

-   Men's and women's synchronized 3m
-   Men's and women's synchronized 10m

At the Olympics, each individual diving competition features a preliminary round, a semifinal, and a final; the synchronized events are final only. In the individual events, the top 18 divers from the prelims advance to the semifinals; from there, the top 12 compete in the finals.
