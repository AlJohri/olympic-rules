Diving 101: Scoring
===================

Learn how diving scoring works at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

**Individual diving**

Judges

For individual events in the Olympics, seven judges and a referee are appointed by diving's international governing body (FINA). The panel of judges for the finals is made up of judges whose nationalities are different from those of the contestants in the finals, if possible. The referee is in charge of the competition and makes sure all regulations are followed but does not score the dives.

Judges award scores on a scale of 0 to 10 in half or whole points according to the following specifications:

**Execution score**
Completely failed: 0 points
Unsatisfactory: .5 to 2 points
Deficient: 2.5 to 4.5 points
Satisfactory: 5 to 6 points
Good: 6.5 to 8 points
Very good: 8.5 to 10 points

What's considered

The aspects of the dives considered by the judges are the run-up, the take-off, the execution of maneuvers, grace and entry into the water. Each dive is to be considered without regard to the difficulty figure.

1.  Approach: The diver's starting position must be fully erect, relaxed, and confident, with arms straight forward, to the sides or over the head. The approach must be smooth, straight, forceful and leading into the hurdle, which is the springing action on the platform or board gaining upward propulsion.
2.  Take-off: Springboard take-offs can propel divers upwards of eight feet above the board. Divers need to show control and balance. The take-off must be bold and the diver must clear the board by an ample safety margin.
3.  Elevation: The amount of spring or lift a diver receives from the takeoff greatly affects the appearance of the dive. Since more height means more time, a higher elevation generally affords greater accuracy and smoothness of movement. Shorter divers can get good height if they have enough strength.
4.  Execution: The dive's components - straight, tuck, pike or free positions - must be performed crisply, with flair and control, and held long enough in flight to clearly identify them. A judge watches for proper mechanical performance, technique, form and grace.
5.  Entry: The entry into the water is very significant because it is the last thing the judge sees and the part probably remembered best. The entry shall in all cases be vertical, or nearly so, with body straight, feet together, and toes pointed. In a head-first entry, arms are extended overhead with hands together. A feet-first entry is almost never used, but in the event that it is, arms are held tightly against the sides for streamlining. The less splash the better.

After each dive, the referee gives a signal and each judge, without consulting with the others, indicates his or her mark for the dive. For individual events, the highest and the lowest of the seven scores are discarded and the total of the remaining mark is multiplied by the degree of difficulty of the dive. That figure is multiplied by 0.6 in order to determine the final score. This weighing factor is used so that scores from a competition with three judges may be compared with a competition with five judges.

Example: A diver in the springboard competition performs a forward dive with a half twist in the straight position, degree of difficulty 2.0, and receives the following scores: 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6.5. The two highest scores (8, 7) and the two lowest scores (7, 6.5) are canceled, and the total of the remaining marks (21) is multiplied by the degree of difficulty (2.0), yielding 42, the score of the dive.

**Synchronized diving**

Judges

Synchronized diving is judged by 11 judges on three different panels: one panel for the execution of each diver (three judges each, six total) and one for the synchronization of the two divers (five judges). The highest and lowest of the six execution scores and the highest and lowest of the five synchronization scores are discarded and the total of the remaining mark is multiplied by the degree of difficulty of the dive. That figure is multiplied by 0.6 in order to determine the final score.

What's considered

The execution scores are based on the same considerations as the individual competition.

The synchronization scores are based on:

1.  The approach
2.  The take-off, including the similarity of height
3.  The coordinated timing of the movements during the flight
4.  The similarity of the angles of entry
5.  The comparative distance from the board at the entry
6.  The coordinated timing of the entries
