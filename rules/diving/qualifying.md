Diving 101: Qualifying
======================

Learn how divers qualified for the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Participants

A maximum of 136 divers (64 men and 64 women plus eight more allocations for men and women of the host country) may compete at the 2016 Rio Games. Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) may enter up to two divers in each of the individual events and one team (of two divers) in each of the synchronized events.

To be entered in the Olympic Games, a diver must meet the following qualifying entry standards:

Automatic qualification: In each of the four individual events, divers ranked 1-12 (semifinalists) at the 16th FINA World Championships (Kazan, Russia; July-August 2015) qualify for the Rio Games. Five divers qualify from each of the five continental championships (hosted by FINA, the governing body of diving) held before the World Cup in Rio de Janeiro in February 2016, where up to 18 more divers can qualify. If the total number of divers has not yet reached 34 in any individual discipline, divers ranked 19th and higher from the World Cup will qualify.

Synchronized diving qualification: For synchronized diving, eight teams will compete in each event, with no country allowed more than a single team per event. The host nation, Brazil, gets an automatic berth into each synchronized diving event. The top three countries from the 2015 World Championships in Kazan, Russia earn berths, and the first four additional countries from the World Cup in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in February 2016 fill out the field.

Age minimum: All divers must turn 14 years old by Dec. 31, 2016 in order to be eligible to compete in the Olympics.
