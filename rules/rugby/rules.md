Rugby 101: Rules
================

The rules of rugby at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

**Ball**
A rugby ball is oval and 28-30 inches long. It's mass (14.5-16.2 ounces) is similar to that of an NFL ball (14-15 oz.).

**Equipment**
Players are allowed (but not required) to wear ankle and shin guards, gloves, helmets, mouth guards and shoulder pads. Women are also allowed to wear chest pads.

**Match Duration**
Matches are 14 minutes with seven-minute halves, plus a two minute break.

The gold-medal match is 20 minutes with 10-minute halves, plus a three minute break.

If a match in the knockout round is tied at the end of regulation, there will be a sudden-death overtime. After a two-minute break, the two teams will play in a five-minute extra time period. If neither team scores, they will switch ends and play a second five-minute extra time period. Switching ends and advancing to another five-minute extra time period continues until the first team scores.

**Pitch**
The pitch is 100m long and 70m wide (110 yards x 77 yards). That is nearly 25 yards wider than an American football field.

**Roster**
In addition to the seven players on the pitch, teams are allowed to have five substitutes.

**Scoring**
Try: 5 points
Conversion: 2 points
Penalty: 3 points
Drop goal: 3 points
