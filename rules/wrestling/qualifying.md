Wrestling 101: Qualifying
=========================

How do wrestlers qualify for the Rio Olympics?

Below is a breakdown of the various qualifying phases for wrestling leading up to the Rio Games. Note that countries qualify quota spots (not individual athletes) to the Olympics. Once a country has earned a quota spot in a certain weight class, it may use its own Trials process to decide which athlete will fill that spot at the Games.

Countries are limited to a maximum of one quota place per weight class, but there is no limit on the number of weight classes that a country may qualify a spot in.

**2016 continental qualification tournaments**
Total quota spots: 144 (8 per weight class)

A series of four continental qualification tournaments provide a second chance for countries to qualify quota spots for the Rio Games. If a country already qualified quota places for specific weight classes at the 2015 World Championships, they are not allowed to enter that weight class at their continental qualification tournament.

At all four tournaments, the top two wrestlers in each weight class qualify an Olympic quota spot for their country.

The top three wrestlers in all men's weight classes and the top two wrestlers in all women's weight classes will earn a quota spot for their country.

**Second 2016 World Qualifying Tournament**
Date: May 6-8, 2016
Total quota spots: 36 (2 per weight class)

This international tournament provides a fourth chance for countries to earn an Olympic quota spot. Only countries who have not yet qualified a quota spot in a given weight class may enter a wrestler in that weight class.

The top two wrestlers in all weight classes will earn a quota spot for their country.

<a href="" id="host"></a>

**Host country places**
Total quota spots: Up to 4

The Olympic host country (in this case, Brazil) is guaranteed four quota places. There is no limit on the number of quota places that Brazil may earn through international and continental qualification tournaments, but should they qualify less than four quota spots, they will be allocated host country places in order to get them to four total spots. The host country places can be used at their discretion across any of the 18 Olympic weight classes that they have not previously qualified for.

Any unused host country places (due to Brazil earning quota spots through qualifying tournaments) will be reallocated by the IOC Tripartite Commission.

<a href="" id="invitation"></a>

**Tripartite Commission invitation places**
Total quota spots: Minimum of 4

Countries are allowed to submit their requests for invitational places. At the end of the qualification period, the IOC Tripartite Commission will then award four quota spots to countries. Any unused host country places will also be reallocated by the commission, meaning that there could be up to eight total spots given out through this process.
