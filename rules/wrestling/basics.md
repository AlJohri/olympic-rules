Wrestling 101: Basics
=====================

What are the variations of Olympic wrestling, and how are weight classes divided?

Wrestling is one of the most storied sports of the Olympic Games, with roots dating back to the original Olympics in ancient Greece. The object is to pin the opponent on the ground or outscore the opponent by executing superior holds, throws and takedowns.

**Weight classes**
For men's wrestling at the 2016 Games, there are six weight classes for each of the three divisions: men's Greco-Roman, men's freestyle and women's freestyle. In the interest of creating parity between genders, the Rio Games will see an expansion of women's weight classes. There had only been 4 Olympic weight classes for women's wrestling since it debuted in 2004; two additional weight classes were added for Rio. The number of weight classes for men's freestyle and Greco-Roman has been reduced from seven to six for both disciplines.

In wrestling, there is no "unlimited" weight class. Boxing terms such as flyweight, welterweight and super heavyweight are no longer used in wrestling, although competitors in the heaviest weight division are often referred to as heavyweights.

Below are the weight classes for each of the Olympic disciplines. The numbers reflect the maximum that a competitor can weigh. (Pound conversions are unofficial.)

**Greco-Roman vs. freestyle**
There are two styles of Olympic wrestling, though the rules for both are virtually identical. The chief difference is that in Greco-Roman, a wrestler may not attack his opponent below the waist, nor use his own legs to trip, lift or execute other holds. In freestyle, both the arms and legs are used to execute holds.
