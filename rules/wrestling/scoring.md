**Ways to win**

-   Pinning the opponent: Also known as a victory by fall.
-   Technical superiority: Amassing a 10-point lead in freestyle or an 8-point lead in Greco-Roman before time runs out.
-   Victory by points: Outscoring the opponent at the end of the match.
-   Injury, withdrawal, default or disqualification of the opponent

**Match tiebreakers**
If a match ends in a tie, the following criteria is used to break to the tie (in order):

-   Highest value of holds: The wrestler who scored the most points on a single hold is the winner. For example, a wrestler who scored a 2-point hold would beat a wrestler who scored nothing higher than 1-point holds.
-   Fewest number of cautions: If both wrestlers had equal-value holds, then number of cautions would be the next tiebreaker. A wrestler that received one caution during a match would beat a wrestler who received two cautions.
-   Last technical point(s) scored: This is the final tiebreaker in freestyle wrestling. Whichever wrestler was the last one in the match to score a point would be declared the winner.
-   Last activity: If a Greco-Roman match ends in a 0-0 scoreless tie, the victory goes to whichever wrestler was deemed to be the most active last. (Freestyle matches can't end in a 0-0 tie.)
