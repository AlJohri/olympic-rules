Fencing 101: Competition format
===============================

Learn about the fencing competition format at the Rio Olympic Games.

The fencing competition employs a direct-elimination format. Qualified fencers will be placed in a draw based on their discipline. The seeding of the individual and team competitors is based upon ranking from the Federation Internationale d'Escrime, the international fencing federation, at the end of May.

Direct elimination determines which athletes and teams advance through the elimination round, the quarterfinals and the semifinals. The winners of the two semifinal bouts face each other to determine the gold and silver medals; the losing semifinalists vie for the bronze medal.
For the team events nations enter squads of three fencers with one reserve athlete.
