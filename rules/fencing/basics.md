Fencing 101: Basics
===================

Learn the basics of fencing at the 2016Â Rio Games.

Individual and team events are contested in one-day, single-elimination tournaments in three fencing disciplines: foil, epee and sabre. In Rio, all team events besides women's foil and men's sabre will be held. Three athletes from each country will qualify as a team and also compete individually. Two athletes per country can qualify for disciplines that do not have team events.
The Rio Olympic fencing tournament begins on Aug 6, Day 1 of the Games, and concludes on Aug 14, Day 9 of the Games.
