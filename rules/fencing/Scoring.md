Fencing 101: Scoring
====================

Learn about the fencing scoring system at the Rio Olympic Games.

**Starting and Stopping**
Bouts begin with the two unmasked opponents saluting first each other and then the officials by raising the blade to the chin and dropping it. Then, masks down, the fencers assume the en garde position. The bout begins on the command, "Pret? Allez!" (literal English translation: "Ready? Go!"). The bout stops on the word "Halt," an order given if a touch is achieved; if the fencing of the competitors is dangerous, confused, or against the rules; if one of the competitors is disarmed or leaves the strip; or if, while retreating, a fencer approaches too near the spectators or the referee.

**Duration**
In individual competition, the winner of a bout is effectively the first to score 15 touches on the opponent. Each touch is worth one point. A bout is a maximum of nine minutes long, divided into three periods of three minutes (with a one-minute break between periods). If the third period is completed before either fencer reaches 15 points, the fencer with the most points is declared the winner.
In team competition, which consists of nine individual bouts (each member of one team faces each member of the other team once), a head-to-head bout lasts three minutes or until one team score reaches a multiple of five. If the ninth bout is completed and neither team has 45 points, the team with the most points is declared the winner.

**Ties**
In the individual tournament, when there is a tie at the end of regulation time, a further minute of competition time is added, and the fencer to score the first touch is declared the winner. Prior to the start of the "sudden death" extra minute, the referee conducts a draw between the two competitors. If no athlete registers a point during the extra time, the winner of the draw is declared the winner of the bout.
If teams are tied at the conclusion of the ninth bout of a match, a further one minute of fencing time will be added. One fencer will be randomly selected and given priority. The fencer who scores the first touch will win the match for his or her team.

**Scoring specifics: Foil**
**Touches:** Points are scored with the tip of the blade only.
**Target Area:** In foil, a touch only counts if it lands within the torso of the body (from shoulders to the groin, front and back). The arms, neck, head and legs are not part of the valid target area.
**Right of way:** When both lights turn on, it rests upon the referee to decide which fencer scores the point. The decision is based on the concept of Right of Way (RoW) which gives the point to the fencer who had priority, i.e. the attacking fencer. Priority is gained in many ways:

-   Beginning to extend the arm before the opponent, which signifies an attack
-   Causing the opponent to miss, either through a parry or retreating out of distance
-   Establishing a point in line
-   Beating the opponent's blade
-   Deceiving the opponent's search

If neither fencer has priority in a double touch situation, the action is called simultaneous and no point is awarded.

**Scoring specifics: Sabre**
**Hits:** Unlike the foil, in which only hits with the blade tip count for a point, sabre hits may be made with the blade's front edge, the last one-third of its back edge, or the tip.
**Target Area:** The permitted target area in sabre is from the bend of the hips (both front and back) to the top of the head, simulating the cavalry rider on a horse.
**Right of way:** When both lights turn on, it rests upon the referee to decide which fencer scores the point. The decision is based on the concept of Right of Way (RoW) which gives the point to the fencer who had priority, i.e. the attacking fencer. Priority is gained in many ways:

-   Beginning to extend the arm before the opponent, which signifies an attack
-   Causing the opponent to miss, either through a parry or retreating out of distance
-   Establishing a point in line
-   Beating the opponent's blade
-   Deceiving the opponent's search

If neither fencer has priority in a double touch situation, the action is called simultaneous and no point is awarded.

**Scoring specifics: Epee**
**Touches:** As with the foil, touches are scored only by the tip of the blade.
**Target Area:** The epeeÂ athlete's entire body is valid -- including head and feet -- making it the largest target area of any of the fencing events.
**Right of Way:** There is no Right of Way rule in epee.
