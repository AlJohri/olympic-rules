2.  Be invited by the IAAF as the best ranked athlete(s) at the end of the qualification period to fill the remaining quota places by event, and respecting the maximum quota per National Olympic Committees (NOC) per event.

**Non-Qualified Athletes**

-   NOCs with no male or female qualified athlete or relay team will be allowed to enter their best male athlete and their best female athlete in one athletic event each, with the exception of the Combined Events, 10,000m and 3000m Steeplechase.
