**Olympic Stadium**
The Olympic Stadium was built in anticipation of the 2007 Pan American Games. It is now the home of the Botafogo Football Club. The stadium's capacity was 45,000 until it was temporarily increased to 60,000 for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. In addition to hosting track and field, the Olympic Stadium will host eight preliminary soccer matches, including the opening match of the women's soccer competition. It is located in the venue cluster in Maracana, along with the Sambodromo (archery), Maracana Stadium (Opening and Closing Ceremonies, soccer) and Maracanazinho (volleyball).

The five road races (men's and women's marathon, men's and women's 20km race walk and men's 50km race walk) will be held on the streets of Rio de Janeiro.
