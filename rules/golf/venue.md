An overview of the Olympic Golf Course

The Olympic Golf Course is located in the Reserva Marapendi, in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood. The course was designed specifically for the Olympics by American golf course architect Gil Hanse. With two artificial lakes, as well as a variety of other obstacles and features, the course promises to be a challenge for the Olympic competitors.

A stand-alone venue, the course is located about three miles from the Olympic Village and just over four miles from the International Broadcast Center.Â Spanning just over 10,440,993 square feet, it has the capacity to hold up to 15,000 spectators during the Games.

Constructed on a piece of reclaimed land, the course was completely paid for by private investors. After the Games, the course will be open to the public in the hopes of growing the sport in Brazil and across South America.
