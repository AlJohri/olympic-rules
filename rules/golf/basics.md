An overview of theÂ basics of Olympic golf

Golf at the Olympics consists of two events: the women's tournament and the men's tournament.

The men's tournament will take place from from Thursday, August 11 through Sunday, August 14, while the women's tournament will occur Wednesday, August 17 through Saturday, August 20.

The men's and women's fields will each be comprised of 60 athletes, for a total of 120 total competing in the golf events at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. The rules for both the men's and women's competition will be the same.

The tournament will consist of 72 holes of individual stroke play. Each competition will be made up of four rounds (18 holes each) played over four consecutive days. Scores will accumulate over the four days and the player with the lowest score will earn the gold medal with the second and third place athletes winning silver and bronze, respectively.

Rounds will be played in groups of three starting on the first tee. For the first and second round, groupings will be decided no later than two days before the start of the event. Groupings for rounds three and four will be dictated according to the cumulative score at the end of the prior round. The leaders will tee off last.
