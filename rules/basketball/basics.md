Basketball 101: Basics

Learn the basics of Olympic basketball

**When and where:**

The Rio Olympic basketball tournaments begin on Saturday, August 6 and conclude on Sunday, August 21. Games will be held at the Carioca Arena 1 and the Youth Arena.

**Teams:**
Basketball at the Olympics consists of two tournaments: one for the men, and one for the women. Each tournament is made up of 12 teams, which qualified for the Games by winning or placing high enough in a preceding FIBA tournament that serves as an Olympic qualifier.

**Rosters:**
For men's and women's basketball teams at the Olympics, rosters are limited to 12 players. For the seventh time, professionals (including NBA and WNBA players) are eligible to compete at the Games. Prior to 1992, only amateurs were allowed to compete.

**Players:**
Five players per team are on the court at one time. Traditionally, the five players would consist of a point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward and center, but with today's basketball trending to a quicker, three-point dominated style, traditional lineups do not always apply. Where teams used to sport lineups with two big men producing most of their offense from inside of the paint or on mid-range jump shots, today's game leans towards a more drive-and-kick, three-point centric attack.

This has led to the rise of versatile wing players and stretch power forwards. Wing players usually play on the perimeter and possess the ability to drive, shoot or pass with great skill. The stretch power forward is often a better shooter than the traditional power forward, but can also penetrate defenses off of the dribble. The term stretch power forward is derived from the player's ability to increase floor spacing, or "stretch" the defense.

**Officials and Referees:**
All officials and referees for the Olympic basketball tournament are appointed by FIBA (basketball's international governing body), according to criteria established by the IOC and FIBA. The scorers, timekeepers, 24-second clock operators and statisticians are appointed by FIBA.

**Game Duration:**
Each game will consist of four ten-minute quarters. If the score is tied after four quarters, the game will continue with as many extra periods as are necessary to break the tie. Each overtime period will be five minutes in length.
