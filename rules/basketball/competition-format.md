Basketball 101: Competition format
==================================

The competition format for the Olympic basketball tournament

**Tournament dates:** Saturday, August 6 - Sunday, August 21

**Location:** Carioca Arena 1Â in the Barra Olympic Park, and the Youth Arena in the Deodoro zone.

**Medal Events:**

-   Men's 12-team tournament - Medals awarded to top three teams
-   Women's 12-team tournament - Medals awarded to top three teams

**Athletes:** Between the men's and women's tournaments, a total of 288 athletes may partake in the competition - with a maximum of 12 players per team.

**Tournament format:** The men's and women's tournament abide by the same format and rules.

In the preliminary round, the 12 teams will be divided into two groups of six with each team in the group playing each other one time. A team earns two points for a win, one point for a loss and zero points for a forfeit.

After the group stage is completed, the four teams in each group with the most points advance to the quarterfinals. The bottom four teams, two from each group, will be eliminated from play and placed in the final standings in accordance with FIBA rules.

If two teams from the same group finish tied in points after the preliminary round, the result of their head-to-head matchup in group play will serve as a tie-breaker. If three or more teams finish the group stage tied, the rankings will be determined by the results of head-to-head games played between them. Then, if necessary, the combined point differential (from in-game play, not points awarded for wins/losses) of the games played between the tied teams will be used to break the tie.

After the preliminary round, the tournament will follow a knockout format for the quarterfinals, semifinals, bronze medal game and gold medal game. In the quarterfinals, the winner will advance and the loser will be eliminated from competition. In the semifinals, the winner will advance to the gold medal game and the loser will play for the bronze medal.
