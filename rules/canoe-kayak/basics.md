**Canoe/Kayak Sprint**
In the canoe/kayak sprint events, a total of 12 gold medals are up for grabs. Athletes sprint to the finish in a straight, calm water (flatwater) course to achieve the shortest time possible. Men compete in eight sprint races and women compete in four. Men's races, consisting of both the canoe and the kayak, are contested at either 200 meters or 1000 meters. The four women's races are contested at 200 or 500 meters and are only in the kayak.

In the following list, "C" denotes the canoe and "K" denotes the kayak, and the numbers indicate how many paddlers are in the boat.
**Men**
Kayak single (K1) 200m
Kayak single (K1) 1000m
Kayak double (K2) 200m
Kayak double (K2) 1000m
Kayak four (K4) 1000m
Canoe single (C1) 200m
Canoe single (C1) 1000m

**Women**

**Canoe/Kayak Slalom**
Deriving from ski slalom, canoe/kayak slalom is held on a steep, man-made course of rapid-flowing rough water also known as whitewater, for the white foam created by the waves. In both men's and women's events, paddlers will race one at a time against the clock and negotiate a 250-meter slalom course consisting of 18-25 gates in the shortest time possible.Â  Green gates are negotiated in the direction of the current and red gates against the current. Judges will add a two second time penalty for touching the gate or a fifty second penalty for failing to pass through them. Four gold medals are up for grab in these slalom events. Men compete in two canoe events and one kayak event, and the women's event is in the kayak.

In the following list, "C" denotes the canoe and "K" denotes the kayak, and the numbers indicate how many paddlers are in the boat.
**Men**
Kayak single (K1)
Canoe single (C1)
Canoe double (C2)

**Women**
Kayak single (K1)

In slalom, a canoe is required to be a minimum of 3.5m long for C1 and 4.1m for C2 and competitors use single-blade paddles and kayaks must be a minimum 3.5m long and competitors use double-blade paddle. All competitors will sit in their canoe or kayak.
