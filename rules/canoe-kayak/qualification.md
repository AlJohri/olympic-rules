Canoe/Kayak 101: Qualification
==============================

Learn more on the qualification system of Olympic canoe/kayak.

There were two opportunities for nations to qualify a maximum of one boat per event for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. The first was at the 2015 ICF World Championships, where the majority of athlete quota places were filled, and the second is at the Continental Qualification Event, held for Europe, Africa, Oceania, Asia and Pan Americas. Individual nations then have trials to determine the athletes who will paddle in the boats.
