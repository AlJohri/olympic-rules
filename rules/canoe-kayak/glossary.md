**Canoe:** A light, narrow open boat propelled by one or more paddlers from a kneeling or sitting position, using a single-bladed paddle.

**Chute:** An area in which a whitewater course suddenly is constricted, compressing and amplifying the current's energy into a narrow tongue of water.

**Cockpit:** The enclosed space in a kayak or slalom canoe in which the athletes sit.

**Deck:** The closed-in area over the bow and/or stem of a canoe or kayak, intended to shed water and strengthen the gunwales.

**Double-bladed paddle:** A paddle with a blade at each end, used by kayakers.

**Downstream:** In the same direction as the flow of the water.

**Downstream gate:** In whitewater, this type of gate is green-and-white striped and is negotiated in the same direction as the water flow.

**Draw:** A stroke where the blade, extended far from the canoe at a 90 degree angle to the direction of travel, is pulled directly toward the side of the canoe, in effort to move the canoe sideways.

**Eddy:** A pool of calmer water out of the main current of a stream; upstream gates often are placed in an eddy.

**Eskimo roll:** When a boat capsizes, but the paddler remains in place as the boat "rolls" into an upright position.

**50-second penalty:** An infraction given to whitewater paddlers for, in most cases, failing to pass through a gate.

**Five-meter rule:** In flatwater, a rule prohibiting any boat from coming within five meters of the boat positioned next to it, thereby preventing it from riding the other boat's wash.

**Flatwater:** Calm water or a slow-moving river current with no rapids.

**River left:** The left side of the waterway as it appears to a paddler facing downstream.

**River right:** The right side of the waterway as it appears to a paddler facing downstream.

**Run:** One traversing of the course from start to finish.

**Single-bladed paddle:** A paddle used in the canoe, this paddle has a blade at only one end, used to stroke on one side of the boat.

**Spray skirt:** A cover worn by paddlers in whitewater events that attaches around the cockpit and seals the paddler into the boat to prevent water from entering.

**Upstream gate:** In whitewater, a red-and-white striped slalom gate that must be negotiated against the flow of the water.
