Soccer 101: Field
=================

The field that soccer is played on at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.

**Dimensions:** The playing area in Olympic soccer matches is a rectangle, which measures 115 yards by 74 yards (105 meters by 68 meters).

**6-yard box:** A smaller rectangle, 6 yards out and 20 yards wide, defines the goal area and is commonly referred to as the "6-yard box." Goal kicks are taken from any point in the 6-yard box.

**Penalty Box:** In front of each goal is a rectangular zone called the penalty area, or "the box," extending 18 yards out from the goal line and 44 yards wide. When "direct kick" infractions occur inside the box, a penalty kick is awarded.

**Halfway Line (Midfield stripe):** A soccer field is divided in two by a halfway line. Substitutions enter and exit the field at the halfway line.

**Center Mark:** Kick-offs to start and restart the game take place at the center mark.

**Center Circle:** When kick-offs occur, players not involved must stand behind the center circle, which has a radius of 10 yards from the center mark. Once the ball is touched, players can enter the circle.

**Touchline (Sideline):** Regardless of whether it's in the air or on the ground, the ball is considered out of play when it fully crosses the touchline. If this happens, the team that did not cause the ball to go out of bounds is awarded a throw-in.

**Penalty Arch:** During a penalty kick, all players must be 10 yards from the penalty mark when the kick is taken, with the exception of the goalkeeper and the player taking the penalty kick. The penalty arch is 10 yards from the mark.

**Corner Arch:** When taking a corner kick, the ball must be placed inside the corner arch, which has a 1-yard radius. Players are not allowed to move the corner flag. Opponents must remain at least 10 yards from the ball until it is kicked into play.

**Penalty Mark (Penalty Spot):** When a penalty kick is awarded, the ball is placed on the penalty mark. Also called the "11-meter mark," it lies about 12 yards from the goal.

**Goal line (End line):** Regardless of whether it's in the air or on the ground, the ball is considered out of play when it fully crosses the goal line. If the team on offense causes the ball to cross the goal line, the defense is awarded a goal kick. If the team on defense causes the ball to cross the goal line, the offense is awarded a corner kick.
