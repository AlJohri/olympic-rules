Soccer 101: Equipment
=====================

The equipment used in soccer at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.

**Goal:** The goal, placed at the center of each goal line, consists of two upright posts joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar. The goal is 24 feet (8 yards) wide and 8 feet high. A net covers the entire goal, with the exception of the goalmouth, to facilitate goal rulings.

**Corner flags:** Corner flags, standing 60 inches tall, are set into each of the four corners of the playing field.

**Ball:** The Olympic soccer ball must have a circumference of no more than 28 inches and no less than 27 inches (size 5). It must weigh no more than 16 ounces and no less than 14 ounces at the start of the match.

**Cleats:** Cleats (also known as "spikes" or "boots") have a leather upper affixed to a hard, plastic sole with shorter, firm-ground cleats or longer, soft-ground cleats. Either pair of cleats helps maintain traction on grass.

**Shinguards:** Shinguards, made of a hard plastic shell over a foam backing and often secured with Velcro straps, are used to protect the shinbone from injury. Injuries to the shin are usually caused from an opponent's kick or sliding tackle, and range from severe tissue pain to fracture or even break. Shinguards are required for all players, including goalkeepers.
