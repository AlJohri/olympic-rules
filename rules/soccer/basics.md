Soccer 101: Basics
==================

The basics of soccer at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.

The soccer competition at the Rio Olympics is composed of a 16-team men's tournament and a 12-team women's tournament, with each team allowed a roster of 18 players, plus two alternates.

Participants in the men's tournament must be under the age of 23 (born before Jan. 1, 1993), with three overage exceptions allowed per team. The women's rosters consist of senior national team players, with no age restriction.

The 16 men's teams are drawn into four groups of four, while the 12 women's teams are drawn into three groups of four. Teams advance from those groups to a knockout stage which ultimately determines medalists.
