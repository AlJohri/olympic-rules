Water polo 101: Basics
======================

Learn the basics of the Olympic sport of water polo at the 2016 Rio Games.

Water polo is one of the oldest Olympic sports, with the men's competition making its debut at the 1900 Games in Paris. Alongside soccer, it was the first team sport to be included in the Olympic program. In the early days, players floated on barrels and swung at the ball with mallets, resembling polo - hence the name. Water polo matches were initially made up of four five-minute quarters, with overtime decided in three minute periods. In 1984, the quarters were extended to seven minutes. The quarters were increased again to eight minutes beginning in 2008.

There are seven players on a team including the goalkeeper. A team has 30 seconds after taking possession of the ball to make a shot on the goal, otherwise the opposing team takes possession.

Ties are not broken in the preliminary round, but for medal matches, two additional three minute periods are played. If the score is still tied, a penalty shootout determines the victor.

Men's teams qualified for the Olympics a few different ways: the winner of the Water Polo World League, the top three teams in the most recent world championships, one each from five continental tournaments (plus the host team is an automatic entry), the top three teams from an Olympic qualifying event that had not already qualified.

Women's teams qualified for the Rio Games by either winning one of five continental tournaments (including the host nation's team's automatic berth) or being in the top three for an Olympic qualifying event behind teams that had already qualified.
