Archery 101: Venue
==================

Learn about the archery venue at the 2016 Rio Olympics Games.

**Sambadrome:**
Archery will be held at the Sambadrome Marques de Sapucai, in Rio de Janeiro. This stadium was built specifically to host the annual parade of Samba Schools during the festival of Carnaval in Rio. It has also hosted concerts by the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and Bob Dylan among others.

The Sambadrome consists of free-standing sectors, which sit on both sides of a long alleyway. In preparation for the Games, the Sambardrome was renovated to increase its capacity from 60,000 to 72,500 spectators. The Sambadrome is not normally used to host sporting competitions, but its use for the Olympics is an example of the Games integration with the city of Rio.
