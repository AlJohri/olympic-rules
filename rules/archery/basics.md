Archery 101: Basics
===================

The basics of the archery competition at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.

There are four archery events at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games:

o    Men's individual
o    Women's individual
o    Men's team
o    Women's team

Each qualified team consists of three archers. Countries may qualify a maximum six archers total - three men and three women.
All four events are contested under the FITA-approved 70m distance and rules. There is a ranking round before moving on to the Olympic round, which is played in a tournament format. In individual competition, there is a field of 64 individuals; in team competition, there is a field of 16 teams.

The ranking round seeds individual and team rounds;  from there, the medal round is conducted in tournament format where one loss eliminates the competitor, save for the semifinals. In that round, the losers move on to bronze medal competition; the winners move on to compete for the gold medal.
