Archery 101: Competition
========================

The format for the archery competition at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.

**Ranking round**
In Olympic archery, a ranking round is used to determine seeding for both the individual and the team competitions. In the ranking round, archers shoot 72 arrows at a target 70 meters away in 12 ends of six arrows each. A perfect score is 720. The time limit in the ranking round is four minutes for each six-arrow end.

In the individual competition, the highest score is seeded first, the second highest is given a No. 2 seed and so on through all 64 seeds. The team competition totals all three of their athletes' scores to determine their team score for ranking. The teams are then seeded 1-16.

**Olympic round**
Individual: The Olympic round for both men and women consists of a match-play tournament in which the 64 competitors, seeded from the ranking round, compete head-to-head (1 vs. 64, 2 vs. 63, etc.), with winners of each match moving on to the next round.

The archers that win the 1/32nd will shoot subsequently in the 1/16th elimination. The field is then reduced to eight quarterfinalists. Quarterfinal winners advance to the semifinals. Then, the two semifinal losers shoot against each other in the Bronze Medal Match; the semifinal winners contest the Gold Medal Match.

Team: The team Olympic round begins with 16 teams on the line, shooting in eight head-to-head matches. The second round, or quarterfinals, consists of the eight winning teams shooting at the same time in four matches. In the semifinal round, the four winning teams meet. The losers of the semifinals shoot for the bronze medal. The winners shoot for the gold.

**Match (individual)**
After making its Olympic debut in London, the set system will be used in Rio. In the individual competition, competitors shoot five sets of three arrows each, alternating, at a target 70 meters (about 230 feet) away, with a 20-second time limit per arrow. An archer wins a set by scoring the highest cumulative score from their three arrows. The competitor who wins the set is awarded two set points; if the competitors tie in a given set, each is given one point. The first archer to six set points is the winner of that match. Technically, an archer could shoot a lower cumulative score and still win the match.

**Tiebreaker system**
A match goes to sudden death if the scores are tied at 5-5 after five sets. In sudden death, each archer shoots one arrow and the one closest to the center of the target wins the match.

**Match (team)**
Teams consist of three archers. Each team shoots 24 arrows, eight per archer. The highest cumulative score wins.

**Tiebreaker system**
If tied, each archer from each team shoots one arrow. The three arrows areÂ totaled and the highest team score wins. In the event of another tie, a second three-arrow end is shot. In the event of a third tie, the closest arrow of all six arrows that were shot will win the match for his team.
