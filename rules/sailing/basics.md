Sailing 101: Basics
===================

Learn more on the basics of Olympic sailing.

Up to 3,000 categories of sailboats reportedly exist around the world, each class with its own set of rules and specifications. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, 10 events are contested in six different types of boats. The women's 49er FX and the mixed Nacra 17 make their Olympic debut at the Rio Games. Boats compete in fleet races, with each regatta lasting a series of days.

There are 10 total events, men compete in five, women compete in four and one event is mixed. Crew sizes range from single-handed to two-person boats. Each class is a different size and shape, requiring certain skills of the sailors in order to operate the boat successfully.
