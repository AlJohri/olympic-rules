==========================

Learn more on the qualification criteria for Olympic sailing.

A total of 380 sailors (274 boats) will compete in 10 classes at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. Each nation may earn one spot per class through a qualification system.  The host country, Brazil, was granted an automatic quota spot for all 10 classes.
