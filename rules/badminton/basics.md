**Badminton Basics**

Played at the fourth pavilion of Riocentro from August 11 through August 20, the Olympic badminton competition will feature five events:

-   Men's singles
-   Women's singles
-   Men's doubles
-   Women's doubles
-   Mixed doubles

All events begin with a preliminary stage: the competitors are divided into groups and each player or doubles pair plays everyone else in their group.

The 16 group winners in the singles and eight best pairs in the doubles qualify for the knockout stage of the competition, which will eventually decide the winners of the medals.

172 competitors (86 men, 86 women) in the five events - men's singles (38 players), women's singles (38 players), men's doubles (16 pairs), women's doubles (16 pairs), mixed doubles (16 pairs) - will be represented.

The May 5, 2016 Badminton World Federation ranking were used to name 34 men's and 34 women's singles players and to name all 48 doubles teams for men's, women's and mixed competitions.
