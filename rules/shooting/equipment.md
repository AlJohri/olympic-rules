*Air rifle (10m rifle):* The air rifle is no bigger than 5.5 kg (12.125) and has a pellet which is shot in thanks to air being compressed from an external lever or a pre-compressed air cylinder. The opening is .177 inches.

*Pistol (50m pistol, Men's 25m rapid fire pistol, Women's 25m pistol):* The men's 50m pistol competitors use a small bore pistol with a .22-inch caliber and with no restrictions on length, width or weight. The women's event and the men's rapid fire competitors use a .22 long rifle caliber pistol capable of firing five shots. A maximum weight of 3.0865 lbs. is specified with a minimum triggers pull weight of 2.2046 lbs. The grip must not touch the wrist, and the pistol must be able to fit in a box shaped 300 x 150 x 50 (all millimeters) with at least 1 millimeter in between the box sides and the gun.

*Shotgun (trap):* Double-barreled, the guns generally weigh around nine pounds and can have barrel lengths up to 32 inches.

*Shotgun (double trap):* The guns are similar to those used in trap, but there is slightly more pellet spread compared to the tight pellet spread of shotguns used in trap.

*Shotgun (skeet):* The guns are regulated to shoot a more open pattern of pellets, and weigh around six-and-a-half pounds because of the shorter barrels that are used.

**Miscellaneous equipment used:**
*Sights:* In rifle, only metallic sights are allowed -- nothing with a lens can be used; in pistol only open sights may be used (optical, mirror, telescope, laser beam or electronically-projected dot sights may not be used).

*Shotgun cartridges:* A pellet load may not exceed 24.5 grams and a pellet may not exceed 2.6 millimeters in diameter.

*Ear/eye protection:* All shooters are urged to wear protection; in the event of ear protection, the device used is not allowed to be a receiver of any kind.
