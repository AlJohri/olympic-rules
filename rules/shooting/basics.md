Shooting 101: Basics
====================

The basics of shooting at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.

**Rifle events**
In the qualification rounds, competitors shoot at a 10-ring target. The eight highest scores advance to the finals -- each rifle event has separate, specific rules regarding how many shots are to be taken. In the finals, the 10 rings are sub-divided into 10 score zones (10.0-10.9, with 10.9 being the highest point total).

**Pistol events**
Scored the same way as rifle events, pistol events have two separate types of targets being used. The precision events (e.g. air and sport pistol) use a 10-ring system similar to the rifle events. The rapid fire event (men only) uses a larger 10-ring target, but only the five highest-scoring rings are used. Pistol shooters are to be standing and must use just one hand, unsupported, while competing. Eight competitors advance to every pistol final except the men's 25m rapid fire pistol, which has just six finalists.

**Shotgun events**
In the three shotgun events, the shooters stand at designated stations and fire at clay targets that are released on or after the shooter's command. A referee must see one visible piece fall from the target for it to be a hit and to award a point to the shooter.
