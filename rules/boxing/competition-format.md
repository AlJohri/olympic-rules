Before the start of competition at the Rio Games, all competitors will report for the general examination and weigh-in, which will be conducted by officials from the International Boxing Association (AIBA). During the official weigh-in, which is done in kilograms, athletes will get on the scale and must come in within the allotted weight range for their division.

<a href="" id="draw"></a> **Competition draw**
A seeding system will be used during the competition. There will be a maximum of four seeds in each men's weight category, and two seeds in each women's weight category. The seedings will be determined by the AIBA according to the AIBA World Rankings.

The competition draw to determine the brackets will be conducted by officials from the AIBA and the IOC after the general medical examination and weigh-in.
