**Walkover** : If a boxer is present in the ring and their opponent fails to appear in the ring after being announced, and one minute after the bell has been sounded, the present boxer will be declared the winner by walkover. A boxer can also win by walkover if their opponent fails their medical examination or fails to make weight before the bout.

**Warning** : Given by the referee to the boxer who commits a serious foul. When the referee signals a warning, the ringside judges deduct a point from that boxer's total score. Three warnings in a bout means disqualification.
