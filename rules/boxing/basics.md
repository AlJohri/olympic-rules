Boxing 101: Basics
==================

What are the different weight classes for Olympic boxing at the Rio Games?

A sport steeped in history, boxing was once a part of the Ancient Olympics in Greece thousands of years ago. It first debuted at the modern Olympic Games in 1904, but for over 100 years, only men competed. In 2012, women's boxing was added to the Olympic program.

Boxing will take place over the course of 16 days at the Rio Games. In that time, medals will be awarded in 13 separate divisions.
