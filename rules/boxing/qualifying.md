Boxing 101: Qualifying
======================

How do boxers qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics?

Below is a breakdown of the various qualifying phases for boxing leading up to the Rio Games. Note that countries qualify quota spots (not individual athletes) to the Olympics. Once a country has earned a quota spot in a certain weight class, it may use its own Trials process to decide which athlete will fill that spot at the Games.

Countries are limited to a maximum of one quota place per weight class, but there is no limit on the number of weight classes that a country may qualify a spot in.

The World Series of Boxing is a boxing series run by the International Boxing Association (AIBA). The final individual rankings from Season V (the 2014-2015 season) determine the first batch of Olympic qualifiers for all men's weight classes.

In the light flyweight, heavyweight and super heavyweight divisions, only the top-ranked boxer earns a quota spot for their country. In all other men's weight classes, the top two boxers in the rankings earn quota spots.

A series of four continental qualification tournaments provide a chance for countries to earn quota spots for the Rio Games. If a country already qualified quota places for specific weight classes, they are not allowed to enter that weight class at their continental qualification tournament.

At all four tournaments, the top-ranked boxers in each weight class qualify an Olympic quota spot for their country. However, the number of quota spots per weight class varies.
