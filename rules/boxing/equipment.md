<a href="" id="uniform"></a> **Uniform**
Competitors shall box in light boots or shoes (without spikes or heels), socks, shorts (not to exceed knee length), and a vest covering the chest and back. The boxers shall wear either a red or blue singlet, depending on the color of their corner. Where trunks and vests are of the same color, the belt line must be clearly indicated by a contrasting color and by using a 6-10 centimeter wide elastic waistband. (The belt line is an imaginary line from the navel to the top of the hips).

Women will have the option of wearing either shorts or a skirt. They are also allowed to wear a breast protector and pubic protector if desired, as long as the breast protector does not shield any target area of the body, including the breastbone. For men, a cup protector must be worn and a jock strap is optional. Mouthpieces are mandatory for everyone.

<a href="" id="headgear"></a> **Headgear**
For the first time since the 1980 Olympics, male boxers in Rio will not be using headgear. According to the International Boxing Association (AIBA), studies have shown that eliminating headgear would result in fewer concussions, making the sport safer. Female boxers, however, will still wear headgear at the 2016 Games, as there is not yet enough research on the effects of headgear on women's boxing.

Headgear must not weigh more than 16 ounces (1 lb).
