Triathlon 101: Qualification
============================

How triathletes qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics.

There will be a total of 110 triathlon competitors at the 2016 Rio Games--55 men and 55 women.

First, athletes collect ITU Olympic qualification points to secure a place for their country on the start line. A maximum of eight National Olympic Committees (NOC) can qualify three places. Other NOCs can qualify a maximum of two.

The next step is for NOCs to select which of its eligible athletes will go to Rio. To be eligible to participate in the Olympics, all athletes must meet one of the following requirements:

-   Win a quota place for their NOC at the ITU Continental Olympic Qualification Events;
-   Win a quota place for their NOC at the 2015 ITU World Olympic Qualification Event;
-   Be among the top 140 in the ITU Olympic Qualification List;
-   Be among the top 140 in the 2015 ITU World Triathlon Series Ranking;
-   Be among the top 140 in the ITU Points List.

The host nation automatically gets one men's and one women's berth.
