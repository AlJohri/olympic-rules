Rhythmic gymnastics 101: Competition format
===========================================

Learn more about the competition format of rhythmic gymnastics.

The 2016 Olympic program for rhythmic gymnastics consists of two events, individual all-around and group. There is a qualification and a final phase to each competition.

INDIVIDUAL

**Individual Qualification** (Aug. 19): Â In the qualification round of the rhythmic gymnastics individual all-around event, all 26 entrants -- in an order determined by a random draw -- perform four exercises, one each with the hoop, ball, clubs and ribbon. The 26 athletes are then ranked based on their total scores, derived from adding the scores attained for each apparatus. After all tie-breaking rules have been applied, the 10 gymnasts with the highest scores (including those tied for 10th place) advance to the all-around final.

**Individual Final** (Aug. 20): The individual final is held the day after the qualification round. Scores do not carry over. The order of gymnasts for the final is determined by a random draw. All 10 finalists again perform four routines with each of the apparatus, and the gymnast with the highest total score wins the gold medal. Silver and bronze go to the gymnasts with the second- and third-highest scores, respectively.

GROUP

**Group Qualification** : In group qualifying, each of the 14 groups performs two routines, the first with five ribbons and the second with three sets of clubs and two hoops. The teams are ranked based on total points. The order of performances will be determined by a drawing of lots. The eight highest-ranked groups qualify for the final.

**Group Final** : The group final is held the day after qualifying. Scores do not carry over. In the final, each group again performs two routines to achieve a total score (maximum of 40.0 points). The highest-scoring group in the final wins gold, and the second- and third-highest ranking groups get silver and bronze.
