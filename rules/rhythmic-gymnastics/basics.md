===============================

Learn more about the sport of rhythmic gymnastics.

The Olympic rhythmic gymnastics competition consists of individual and group events for women. There will be a total of 26 individual gymnasts and 14 groups of five gymnasts, for a total of 96 athletes. Each country is allowed a maximum of two individual entries and one group.

There are four apparatus used in rhythmic gymnastics at the 2016 Rio Olympics: hoop, ball, clubs and ribbon. Individual rhythmic gymnastics perform four routines, one with each apparatus. Group gymnasts perform two routines, one with five ribbons and the other with three sets of clubs and two hoops.

In rhythmic gymnastics, acrobatic feats such as flips and handsprings are prohibited. Instead, the athletes perform ballet-influenced routines that emphasize grace, flexibility and musical interpretation. They must keep the apparatus constantly in motion and handle it in a variety of difficult ways, including throws and catches.

At the Olympics, rhythmic gymnastics and synchronized swimming are the only two sports that are women-only.
