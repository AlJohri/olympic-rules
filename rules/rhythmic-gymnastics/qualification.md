Rhythmic gymnastics 101: Qualification
======================================

Learn more about how countries qualify to the Olympics in rhythmic gymnastics.

**Individuals**
Each qualifying National Olympic Committee (NOC) may enter a maximum of two gymnasts for the individual all-around competition. The total number of individual competitors in rhythmic gymnastics is 26 athletes. All participants must turn 16 by Dec. 31, 2016.

The 15 best gymnasts, maximum two per country, from the 2015 World Championships qualified their country a non-nominative entry into the Rio Games. Eight more gymnasts qualified nominative berths (they earned the Olympic spot for themselves, so their country cannot choose to send another gymnast) through their results at the 2016 Rio Test Event in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A rhythmic gymnast from the host country, Brazil, was given an automatic berth; a Continental Representation berth was given to a gymnast to ensure all continents will be represented; and the Olympic Tripartite Commission also gave a berth to a gymnast who had not yet qualified.

The countries and athletes who qualified individual berths for the Rio Olympics:

-   Russia (2)
