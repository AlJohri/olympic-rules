Rhythmic gymnastics 101: Venue
==============================

Learn more about the rhythmic gymnastics venue.

The rhythmic gymnastics competition at the 2016 Rio Olympics will be held in the Rio Olympic Arena. The arena was built for the 2007 Pan American Games and is currently the training center for Brazil's artistic gymnastics team. For the first time in Olympic history, all three Olympic gymnastics disciplines--artistic, rhythmic and trampoline--will be competed in the same venue. The venue will have a seating capacity of approximately 13,200.

Located in the Barra zone, the Rio Olympic Arena will be in the heart of the Games. Nearby venues include the Olympic Tennis Centre, Aquatics Stadium and Golf Course. The Olympic Village, where the athletes will be housed during the Games, is also in the Barra zone.

For both individual and group competitions, the floor area is a square measuring 13 by 13 meters (42 feet, 8 inches square). A zone of 50 centimeters (1 foot, 7 1/2 inches) is marked around the central square, allowing extra space at the edges for group routines. Unlike artistic gymnastics, the floor is not springy.
