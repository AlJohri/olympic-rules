**Tournament format:** The men's and women's tournament abide by the same format and rules.

In the preliminary round, the 12 teams will be divided into two groups of six with each team in the group playing each other one time. A team earns two points for a win, one point for a draw and zero points for a loss.

After the group stage is completed, the four teams in each group with the most points advance to the quarterfinals. The bottom four teams, two from each group, will be eliminated from play.

After the preliminary stage, teams are ranked based on the number of points they earned in the group stage. If there is tie, goal differential of all matches serves as a tie breaker. If the two teams tie for goal differential, then whichever team scored more total goals in the group stage earns the higher ranking. Quarterfinals matchups are then decided based on ranking.

The quarterfinals, semis, bronze-medal match and gold-medal match will follow a knockout format. In the quarterfinals, the winner of a match advances to the semifinals while the loser is eliminated from the tournament. In the semifinals, the winner advances to the gold medal game while the loser will play in the bronze medal bout.
