Handball 101: Venue
===================

Handball at the 2016 Rio Olympics will be played in teh Future Arena

Located in the Barra Olympic Park, the Future Arena will host every handball match at the 2016 Games. The stadium holds 12,000 people and was built specifically for the Rio Olympics.

Fittingly named, the Future Arena was constructed with life after the Olympics in mind. The venue is completely temporary and the materials used for the arena will be transformed into four public schools across Rio de Janeiro.
