=============================

Learn more about where modern pentathlon will be held in Rio.

The modern pentathlon competition will be held at three separate venues in the Deodoro zone:

**Deodoro Aquatics Center (Swimming)**
The swimming event will be held at the 2,000-seat Deodoro Aquatics Center. The venue has hosted modern pentathlon at the 2007 Pan American Games and 2011 CISM World Military Games.

**Youth Arena (Fencing)**
The fencing event will be held at the 4,000-seat Youth Arena, a new venue. It is located in the Deodoro zone, less than 200m from the Vila Militar rail station. The Youth Arena will also host basketball preliminary matches.

**Deodoro Stadium (Riding, Combined Event)**
The riding and combined events will be held at the 15,400-seat Deodoro Stadium. The temporary venue was built on an existing polo field beside the Youth Arena and Deodoro Aquatics Center. The three venues are close enough to allow spectators and other accredited individuals to travel between them on foot. The Deodoro Stadium will also host the rugby competition.
