Trampoline 101: Qualification
=============================

How the trampoline athletes qualified for the Olympics.

The countries listed below qualified spots (maximum two per country) into the Rio Olympics based on results at the 2015 World Championships and 2016 Rio Test Event:

Women: China (2), Belarus (2), Canada, Great Britain (2), Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Japan, Uzbekistan, Germany, Portugal, United State of America, France

Men: China (2), Belarus, Russia (2), Japan (2), France, New Zealand, Portugal, United State of America, Great Britain, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Kazakhstan

The athletes do not qualify spots for themselves, but for their country. For example, the Chinese athletes that earned four Olympic berths for their country at the 2015 Worlds are not guaranteed to receive those berths at the Olympics. The Chinese gymnastics federation will choose their two Olympic athletes a few months before the Games.

There will be a total of 32 trampoline athletes, 16 men and 16 women, at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
