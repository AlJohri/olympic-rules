Trampoline 101: Basics
======================

Learn the basics of the high-flying sport of trampoline.

The trampoline was said to have been developed by Eskimos and invented--according to circus lore--by a French trapeze artist named du Trampolin. More officially, American inventor George Nissen designed the first modern-style trampoline in 1936. The U.S. military used his portable device during World War II to train pilots and soldiers. Nissen, then 86, was present in Sydney to witness trampoline's Olympic debut at the 2000 Games.

The Olympic trampoline competition consists of an individual event for men and an individual event for women. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, the men's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday, Aug. 12th. The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Saturday, Aug. 13th.

There will be a total of 32 competitors in trampoline: 16 men and 16 women. Countries are allowed a maximum of two male and two female trampoline athletes. To be eligible to compete in Rio, each competitor must turn 18 by Dec. 31, 2016.
