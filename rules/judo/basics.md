<a href="" id="whatisjudo"></a> **What is judo?**
Judo is a Japanese martial art with roots that trace back hundreds of years to forms of jiu-jitsu. In the late 1800s, Dr. Jigoro Kane - known as the "Father of Judo" - compiled the best parts of various martial arts to form a new system known as judo.

As a martial art, judo stands out for commonly being taught as a competitive sport, rather than purely as a form of self-defense. It is also less harsh than other martial arts, with a focus on using an opponent's energy against them. In fact, the term "judo" translates to "the gentle way."

The aim in judo is to control the opponent. To do this, athletes apply principles of balance and leverage to:

-   Throw the opponent to the mat on his back.
-   Immobilize an opponent on any part of his back.
-   Apply armlocks to the elbow. (Joint locks elsewhere constitute a serious rules violation.)
-   Choke the opponent while avoiding any action that might injure the opponent's neck or spine.

Unlike taekwondo and karate, there is no kicking or punching in judo. Rather, a common move is a leg sweep, designed to knock an opponent off balance. An off-balance judoka is liable to find himself thrown. A perfectly-executed throw results in the abrupt termination of the match. If successful, this move - called an "ippon" - can end a match in as little as four seconds. Otherwise, the match continues with the athletes standing upright or on the mat grappling for pins, chokes or armlocks.
