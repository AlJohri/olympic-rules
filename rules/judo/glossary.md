Judo 101: Glossary
==================

What are some of the various terms encountered in Olympic judo?

**Armbar** : A ground grappling (newaza) technique in which one judoka applies pressure to an opponent's elbow joint in order to get the opponent to tap out (give up). If the opponent does not tap out, they risk suffering a dislocated elbow. This move is capable of ending a match by ippon. Also known as an armlock.

**Ashi-waza** : Foot techniques.

**Body drop** : With an uchi-mata-like entry, the thrower sidesteps in front of the opponent's legs, keeping both legs on the ground and tripping the opponent over an extended leg. Also known as "tai otoshi."

**Choke hold** : A ground grappling (newaza) technique in which one judoka chokes or strangles the opponent by encircling the neck with an arm, the legs or the lapels. The object is to get the opponent to "tap" (give up) or "nap" (pass out). This move is capable of ending a match by ippon. Also known as a strangle hold.

**Dan** : A grade of black belt.

**Deashi-barai** : Foot-sweep technique.

**Gatame-waza** : Pinning techniques.

**Hajime** : The referee's command to begin the match.

**Hantei** : A call for judgment when the match ends with a tied score.

**Harai goshi** : This technique is an exact replica of uchi-mata, but the throwing leg goes in front of both opponent's legs instead of in between the legs.

**Ippon** : A score that ends the match and awards an automatic victory. An athlete can score an ippon in multiple ways: executing a "perfect" throw that puts the opponent on their back with speed and force; pinning the opponent for 20 seconds; forcing their opponent to submit, or incapacitating the opponent, via armlock or choke hold.

**Ippon-seoi-nage** : From a one-handed sleeve or lapel grip, the thrower traps the opponent's arm/shoulder by bringing his or her arm under the opponent's armpit. At the same time, the thrower turns his or her back to the opponent making contact, then lifts the opponent on his or her back, bending and turning to throw.

**Judogi** : The judo uniform, which consists of a thick cotton jacket and loose-fitting pants. The jacket is tied together with a belt. In national and international competition, players are required to wear a white or blue judogi. Also known as a gi.

**Soremade** : The refreee's command to end a match.

**Tapout** : The act of giving up, or submitting, to the opponent. The surrendering judoka taps their arm, mat, self, or opponent repeatedly to ask him to release the technique. The surrendering judoka can also say "maitta" (I give up). Tapping out ends the match.
