Judo 101: Qualifying
====================

How do athletes qualify for the 2016 Rio Games?

Below is a breakdown of the qualifying process for judo leading up to the Rio Games. Note that in judo, quota spots are allocated to specific athletes, rather than countries. However, there are scenarios where more than one athlete from the same country in a given weight class is ranked high enough to directly qualify. In those scenarios, the country can decide which of those athletes to award the quota place to. (There is a limit of one athlete per country per weight class.)

<a href="" id="rankings"></a> **How the rankings work**
The qualification period runs from May 30, 2014 through May 30, 2016. During that two-year span, athletes compete in International Judo Federation (IJF) sanctioned events to accumulate ranking points. There are six different classes of events (in order of prestige): World Championships, Masters, Grand Slams, Continental Championships, Grand Prix, Continental Opens. The more prestigious events earn an athlete more points. For example, a first-place finish at a World Championship event pays out 900 points, while a first-place finish at a Continental Open pays out just 100 points.

Events that take place in the second half of the two-year qualification period count for twice as many points as events that take place in the first half of the period.

Points are calculated by taking an athlete's five best results (plus one extra result from the Continental Championships or Masters) from each half of the qualification period and adding them together. Events from May 30, 2014 through May 30, 2015 will be worth 50%, and events from May 30, 2015 through May 30, 2016 will be worth 100%.

<a href="" id="direct"></a> **Direct qualification**
Date: May 30, 2016
Total men's quota spots: 154 (22 per weight class)
Total women's quota spots: 98 (14 per weight class)

The qualification period for the Rio Games ends on May 30, 2016. At that time, the IJF's updated World Ranking List will be used to allocate qualification places.

For all men's weight classes, the top 22 athletes on the World Ranking List will be directly qualified, with a maximum of one athlete per country in each weight class. If a country has more than one athlete ranked in the top 22, that country can decide which athlete receives the qualification place.

For all women's weight classes, the top 14 athletes on the World Ranking List will be directly qualified, with a maximum of one athlete per country in each weight class. If a country has more than one athlete ranked in the top 14, that country can decide which athlete receives the qualification place.

<a href="" id="continental"></a> **Continental qualification**
Total men's quota spots: 60
Total women's quota spots: 40

The World Ranking List will be used to a create a Continental Ranking List for each continent. The Continental Ranking List will rank all athletes from that continent across all weight classes and genders according to their World Ranking Points.

Athletes with the most points on the Continental Ranking List will qualify through continental qualification, but there are two restrictions: 1) no more than one athlete per country can qualify through this process across all weight classes and genders; 2) no more than two athletes per continent can qualify in each weight class through this process.

Each continent is allocated a specific number of qualification places:

-   Europe: 25 (14 men, 11 women)
-   Africa: 24 (14 men, 10 women)
-   Pan American: 21 (13 men, 8 women)
-   Asia: 10 (12 men, 8 women)
-   Oceania: 10 (7 men, 3 women)

<a href="" id="host"></a> **Host country places**
Total quota spots: 14 (1 per weight class)

The host country - in this case, Brazil - is guaranteed one quota spot in each weight class.

<a href="" id="invitation"></a> **Tripartite Commission Invitation places**
Total quota spots: 20

Countries are allowed to submit their requests for invitational places. At the end of the qualification period, the IOC Tripartite Commission will then award 20 quota spots to various countries.

Invitation places can only be allocated to countries that have averaged fewer than nine athletes at the past two Olympic Games.
