Field Hockey 101: Equipment
===========================

The equipment used in field hockey at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.

**Goalkeeper**
A goalkeeper usually wears protective headgear, including a full helmet with full-face protection. The leg pads worn may not exceed 12 inches in width and hand protectors may not exceed 9 inches in width and 14 inches in length.

**Goal Cage**
Positioned outside the field of play at the center of the back line, the goal cage is 7 feet (2.14 meters) high, 12 feet (3.66 meters) wide and 4 feet (1.22 meters) deep. The goal cage is lined with boards on the back and sides measuring 18 inches tall.

**Ball**
Made of solid plastic, the dimpled ball used for field hockey weighs 5.5 to 5.75 ounces with a circumference of about 9 inches. When struck forcefully, the ball, which is slightly larger than a baseball, can reach speeds of up to 100 miles per hour.

**Stick**
The J-shaped sticks used in field hockey are between 36 and 38 inches long and usually weigh between 18 and 22 ounces. The heaviest a stick can weigh is 26 ounces. The sticks, which must be made out of wood, have a curved head and are rounded on one side (right-hand side) and flat on the other (left-hand side). Only the flat side can be used to hit the ball. There are no left-handed sticks in field hockey. Those players that are left-hand dominant must convert to the right-handed sticks.

**Face Mask**
Provides head and face protection for players during short corners. These masks can only be worn by defenders during a short corner. Once the ball is cleared, players must remove masks.
