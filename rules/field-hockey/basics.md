Field Hockey 101: Basics
========================

The basics of field hockey at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.

The Rio Olympic field hockey competitions for men and women begin with round-robin play, involving teams divided into two groups -- Pool A and Pool B. In the 12-team men's and women's tournaments, six teams are in each pool.

In the preliminary round robin, each team plays the other teams within its pool. The top four teams in each pool advance to the quarterfinals.
The winners of the quarterfinal matches advance to the semifinals. The winners of the semifinals play in the Gold Medal Match, while the losers of the semifinals play for the bronze medal.
