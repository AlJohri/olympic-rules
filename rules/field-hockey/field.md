Field Hockey 101: Field
=======================

The field that field hockey is played on at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.

Similar in size to a football field, the rectangular pitch measures 100 yards (91.40 meters) long and 60 yards (55 meters) wide. Three lines cross the width of the field: one in the middle, and two others 25 yards from each back line.

**Penalty Spots**
Penalty spots are placed in front of the center of each goal with the middle of each spot located 7 yards (6.40 meters) from the inner edge of the goal line. These marks identify the spot where penalty strokes are taken.

**Artificial Turf**
Since the 1976 Montreal Olympics, all international field hockey matches have been played on artificial turf. Prior to each game the turf is watered down so the ball sticks better to the ground.

**23-Meters Area**
On each half of the pitch, a straight line is drawn 25 yards (22.90 meters) out from and parallel to the corresponding back line. Those two lines, and the sidelines joining them, frame the 23-meters area. Free hits and penalty corners are awarded for infractions committed inside this area.

**Shooting Circle**
This is a semicircle extending 16 yards (14.63 meters) from each goal, marking the area where shots can be taken and goals scored. Goal-scoring shots from outside this area are not counted unless a player within the circle deflects it.

**Broken Lines**
Drawn outside and parallel to the shooting circle, broken lines identify the area 5.47 yards (5 meters) from the edge of the circle.
