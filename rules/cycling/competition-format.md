Cycling 101: Competition format
===============================

A brief overview of the competition format for the various cycling events at the 2016 Rio Games

**Road**

**Road race**
Competitors in both the men's and women's road races complete a single loop course that also includes lap(s) around the Grumari Circuit (one lap for women, four laps for men) and the Canoas/Vista Chinesa Circuit (one lap for women, three laps for men ). The course is about 159.32 miles (256.4 km) long for the men and approximately 87.61 miles (130.3 km) for the women. Countries are limited to five participants for men, four for women, and medals are awarded to the first three riders across the finish line.

**Time Trial**
In road cycling's individual time trial events (one for men, one for women) each competitor gets one opportunity to ride the course. The course is about 18.52 miles (29.8 km) long with the women completing one lap around the Grumari Circuit and the men completing two. Â The maximum number of participants for the individual time trial event is 40 men and 25 women with no more than two riders representing a single country. The rider that finishes the course in the fastest time is the winner with silver and bronze awarded to the second and third fastest athletes.

**Mountain Biking**
The mountain-bike discipline contested at the Olympics is cross-country (as opposed to downhill or slalom). There are no preliminary or qualifying races -- only a final. The Olympic race begins with a mass start in which riders are positioned according to their current world ranking so that the higher-ranked riders are near the front. The rider who crosses the finish line first is the gold medalist. Silver goes to the runner-up, bronze to the third-place finisher.

**BMX**
BMX features one men's and one women's event. Races are held on circuits of around 350 meters, including jumps, banked corners and other obstacles. Both the men's and women's events starts with an individual time trial run to determine seeding for the next phase of the competition. From there, the men compete in a quarterfinal, while the women proceed straight to the semis. Eight riders compete in each race from the quarterfinals onwards.

**The Sprint**
The men's and women's sprint events at the Olympics play out similarly. The format is broken down as follows:

Qualification
All sprint entrants compete in a preliminary 200m time trial, from which the 18 fastest advance to a tournament-style competition.

First round
The field of 18 cyclists is divided into nine head-to-head match-ups, with the fastest qualifier racing the slowest qualifier once, the second-fastest racing the second-slowest once, and so forth. The nine winners automatically advance. The nine losers enter a repechage phase, featuring three separate three-up matches; the three winners have new life and the six losers are eliminated.

Second round
The 12 remaining competitors are divided into six head-to-head match-ups involving one race. The six winners automatically advance. The six losers enter a repechage phase, featuring two separate three-up races; the two winners have new life, the four losers ride in a four-up race to determine places 9-12.

Quarterfinals
The eight remaining competitors are divided into four head-to-head match-ups. The quarterfinal matches are best-of-three-heats. Quarterfinal winners advance to the semifinals; quarterfinal losers ride in a four-up race for places 5-8.

Semifinals
The four quarterfinal winners comprise the semifinal field. The two semifinal matches are best-of-three-heats.

Bronze-medal final
The semifinal losers contest a best-of-three-heat match. Bronze goes to the winner; the loser is fourth.

Gold-medal final
The semifinal winners contest a best-of-three-heat match. Gold goes to the winner; the loser takes silver.

**Team Sprint**
For the team sprint (teams of three riders for the men and two for the women) a qualifying round is held to determine the eight teams to advance (based on fastest times in a team time trial). Those eight teams are then divided into four head-to-head matches. The two fastest winners meet to determine gold and silver; the other two race for bronze.

**Team Pursuit**
For the team pursuit (teams of four riders for the men and three for the women), competition begins with a qualifying round. The eight fastest teams from qualifying advance to the first round of head-to-head racing. In this first round, teams are seeded based on qualifying times so the fasteset team races the slowest, the second-fastest races the second-slowest, and so on. The four winners in the first round advance to the medal round, where the two fastest teams from the first round meet to determine gold and silver; the other two race for bronze. In each race, the men complete 4,000 meters while the women complete 3,000.

**Keirin**
The Keirin, pronounced "kay-rin," was popularized in Japan. The competition entails a first round, repechages, a second round and a final. In the first round, 21 riders compete in three heats of seven cyclists. From those heats and an ensuing repechage stage, 12 riders advance to the second round. The second round consists of two heats of six riders. The three top finishers in each second-round heat advance to the final to compete for places 1-6, while the rest race for places 7-12.

**Omnium**
This event favors endurance riders with its six races: flying lap (timed), points race (30 km for the men, 20 km for the women), an elimination round (riders in the back are pulled at various intervals), individual pursuit (4,000 meter time trail for the men, 3,000 meters for the women), scratch race and a time trial (1,000 meters for the men, 500 meters for the women). Points are given in reverse order (one point for first place, two points for second and so on), with the rider with the lowest score taking gold.
