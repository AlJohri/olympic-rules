Volleyball 101: Equipment
=========================

Learn about the volleyball equipment used at the Rio Olympic Games.

**Court**
Dimensions
The playing area includes the volleyball court and the free zone. The rectangular court measures 18 by 9 meters (59 feet, 1 inch by 29 feet, 6 inches). It is surrounded by a free zone extending 5m (16 feet, 4 inches) from the sidelines and 6.5m (21 feet, 4 inches) from the end lines.

Lines
The lines on the court are a light color, and the surface of the court and the free zone must be of different colors. All lines are 5 centimeters (2 inches) wide. A ball hitting the line is considered in. An "attack line," parallel to and 3m (9 feet, 10 inches) from the net, divides each team's side of the court into two zones: the front zone (offensive) and the rear zone (defensive). A back-row player executing an attack hit must jump from behind this line.

Service zone
The service zone runs the length of each end line (9m), extending out to the end of the free zone.

**Net**
Dimensions and height
The court is divided into two equal parts by a net, which is placed vertically over the court's center line and divides the court into equal 9m halves (29 feet, 6 inches by 29 feet, 6 inches). The top of the net is 2.43m (8 feet) high for men and 2.24m (7 feet, 4 inches) for women. The net is 1m (3 feet, 3 inches) tall and 9.5 to 10m (31 feet, 2 inches to 32 feet, 10 inches) wide, so as to slightly extend across each sideline.

Bands
The top band of the net is 7cm (2.75 inches) and the bottom band is 5cm (2 inches). Both are threaded with cable or rope to keep the net taut and fastened to the two poles supporting the net outside the sidelines.

Antennae
At each end of the net, there is an antenna extending 80 centimeters (31.5 inches) above the net. The antennae are considered part of the net -- a ball hit toward the opponent's court must pass an antenna on the inside to be considered legal.

**Ball**
An Olympic volleyball is spherical, made of a flexible leather or synthetic leather exterior, while its interior is an inflatable rubber or other similar material. Its circumference is 65-67cm (about 26 inches); its weight is 260-280 grams (about 9.5 ounces). Prior to the Sydney Games, the FIVB introduced a ball with yellow, blue and white panels. This ball replaced the traditional all-white ball as the international standard.

**Dress**
A player's dress consists of a jersey, shorts, socks and shoes. In many cases, players will wear knee pads as well. All jerseys must be the same color, except for the libero, who wears the team's alternate jersey.
