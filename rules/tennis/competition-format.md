Tennis 101: Competition format
==============================

Learn more about tennis' competition format at Rio 2016.

The Olympic tennis event will be designed in a tournament bracket format.

In the men's and women's singles competitions, each featuring draws of 64 competitors, one athlete will have to win six consecutive matches to win the gold medal. The Olympic tournament is designed so that after a competitor has lost a match, they are eliminated from that tournament bracket. The only exception for this is the semifinal matches: The losers of those matches will meet in the Bronze Medal Match to determine the third and fourth-place finishers.

In the men's and women's doubles matches, the format is the same as the singles, though the field for each is made up of 32 doubles teams, meaning one team will have to win five consecutive matches to take home the gold medal. Similarly, the field for mixed doubles begins with 16 teams, meaning one team will have to win four consecutive matches to earn gold.
