Taekwondo 101: Qualifying
=========================

How do athletes qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics?

Below is a breakdown of the various qualifying phases for taekwondo leading up to the Rio Games. Note that countries qualify quota spots (not individual athletes) to the Olympics. Once a country has earned a quota spot in a certain weight class, it may use its own Trials process to decide which athlete will fill that spot at the Games.

**Qualification through WTF Olympic Ranking**
Date: December 2015
Total quota spots: 48 (6 per weight class)

The top six ranked athletes in each weight category in the WTF Olympic Ranking list at the end of December 2015 qualify one spot for their country for the Olympic Games. A maximum of one athlete per country can qualify a spot in each weight class. A country can qualify a maximum of eight athletes (four men, four women) through this process.

**Qualification through Continental Qualification Tournaments**
Total quota spots: 72 (9 per weight class)

The Olympic field is rounded out through a series of five continental qualification tournaments. Only countries that have qualified less than two male athletes or less than two female athletes can participate in the tournaments. (If a country has already qualified two or more male athletes through the WTF Olympic Ranking, it can not send any male athletes to the tournament; same for countries that have qualified two or more female athletes.) A country can qualify a maximum of four athletes (two men, two women) through this process.

The country hosting the Olympics (in this case, Brazil) is not eligible to participate in their continental qualification tournament, as that country will already be receiving four automatic quota places.

Information on each continental qualification tournament is below.

**Host country places**
Date: December 2015
Total quota spots: 4 (2 men, 2 women)

The Olympic host country (in this case, Brazil) is guaranteed up to four automatic quota spots. (They are allowed to qualify up to eight spots through the WTF Olympic Ranking, just like any other country, but should they qualify fewer than four spots through that process, they will still be able to send two men and two women in the weight classes of their choosing.) The country must specify the weight classes they wish to allocate their host country places to by the end of December 2015.

**Tripartite Commission invitation places**
Total quota spots: 4 (2 men, 2 women)

Countries are allowed to submit their requests for invitational places. At the end of the qualification period, the IOC Tripartite Commission will then award four quota places (two male, two female) to countries in weight classes that were not selected for host country places.
