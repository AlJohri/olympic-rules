**History**
Taekwondo is a martial art that was developed in Korea, with origins dating back over 2,000 years. The term "taekwondo" - which translates to "the way of the foot and first" in Korean - was officially coined in the 1950s after the unification of numerous schools around the country that were teaching variations of the martial art.

Taekwondo first became a demonstration sport at the 1988 Seoul Olympics and was eventually added to the Olympic program in 2000. It has remained a full-competition medal event ever since.

**"The way"**
Taekwondo is more accurately called "a way" rather than a sport because it also incorporates a philosophy for living. Its five basic tenets are:
1. Courtesy
2. Integrity
3. Perseverance
4. Self-control
5. Indomitable spirit

In the words of Grand Master Lee Jhoon-Koo, the godfather of the sport, "Taekwondo without philosophy is nothing more than a street fight."

Karate, in contrast, means "empty hand." The biggest difference between karate and taekwondo is that a karate match involves almost four times more punching than kicking. Taekwondo is the opposite; it features far more kicking than punching.

**Classes**
Traditionally, taekwondo competitions consist of 16 weight classes, eight for men and eight for women. In the Olympics, there are only eight classes total - four for each gender - because the International Olympic Committee (IOC) limits the total number of taekwondo entrants to 128 (64 men, 64 women). The weight divisions used are broader than those used in other competitions and are therefore labeled as Olympic classes.

Starting in 2008, two bronze medals were awarded in each weight class.

**Weigh-in**
To ensure that a competitor is eligible to compete in his or her weight class, weigh-ins are held the day before the scheduled competition. Athletes wear underwear during the weigh-in, but can choose to be weighed in the nude. To help eliminate disqualifications, athletes are given access to replica scales so they can check their status in advance of the official weigh-in.
